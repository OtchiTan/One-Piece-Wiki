# Introduction

### What is this book?

This is a Devil Fruit Encyclopedia that can be used for running your own D&D campaign using the One Piece Setting. For more rules for running such a campaign, consider checking out the companion books [Dungeons and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ItlMSW6ztZTm) and [Dungeons and Devil Fruits Dungeon Master's Guide](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/sK-UDzk7x8U_). When combined with the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB, this book offers a deeper understanding of the principles that shape these powers within the 5th Edition D&D landscape.


Within these pages, you'll discover an extensive collection of Devil Fruits, each presented with magic item-inspired stat blocks. While many are drawn directly from the series, others are entirely original or adapted for D&D 5th Edition. For those who wish to introduce an element of randomness to finding these fruits, **Chapter 7** of the Dungeons and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook features tables allowing for random Devil Fruit generation. Alternatively, DMs can personally handpick specific Devil Fruits to enhance the abilities of players or enemies.

### Severe power discrepancies with Devil Fruits?

It's possible that, with sheer randomness, players may end up with an exceptionally powerful or underwhelming Devil Fruit. This inherent unpredictability is what renders the Devil Fruits so interesting, yet risky. If you believe this randomness detracts from the enjoyment or balance of your game, consider personally choosing the fruits that align with your own campaign's balance and design philosophy. You're also encouraged to adjust any Devil Fruit sheets to better match your group's preferences.

Should you wish, consider introducing scaled versions of the powers, especially for the rarer Devil Fruits. This scaling option depends on player level or progress throughout the campaign. While this approach might initially temper the excitement of certain Devil Fruits, it allows DMs to distribute more formidable Devil Fruit without destroying the game's balance early on.

To the right, you'll find optional Devil Fruit advancement rules based on player levels, tailored to the distinct types of Devil Fruits: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. These regulations primarily target the substantial advantages that Very Rare and Legendary Devil Fruits might grant early in a campaign. For instance, a Legendary Devil Fruit granting 17 charges and access to 9th level spells might be restricted to its 5th level spells and a maximum of 9 charges for a level 9 player, until they reach later levels in the campaign. This would NOT raise a Devil Fruit's highest spell level, maximum charges or maximum challenge rating if it has lower than the threshold on these tables, unless a player takes the Devil Fruit Evolution advancement available in the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB. Regardless of these limitations, all other abilities on the Devil Fruit sheet remain available. Such a system can add layers of progression, enriching the narrative while ensuring gameplay remains balanced.

CHAPTER 0 | INTRODUCTION

### Should I allow my players to view this book?

The question of whether players should be privy to this compendium is a valid concern. Perhaps you've crafted a scenario where players uncover a book detailing all known Devil Fruits—a treasure mentioned in the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB's Underworld Markets section. Should such a situation arise, there are several paths you can take.

One approach is to present this Encyclopedia as is, with the caveat that the Devil Fruit abilities described can vary among users. A more restrained option is to let players see only the Devil Fruit names, classifications, appearances, and general descriptions, keeping the exact stats and precise abilities under wraps to prevent metagaming. If you're particularly wary of metagaming, consider unveiling a condensed version, showcasing a select few "known" Devil Fruits accompanied by rudimentary descriptions, without delving into specifics. The latter two alternatives are my personal recommendations, but the choice, of course, is yours.

### Some devil fruits aren't included! Why not?

In the process of crafting this system and compendium, I chose to spotlight 240 Devil Fruits. This isn't to imply a limitation on the number of Devil Fruits in your campaigns, but rather to present a curated collection that can be seamlessly incorporated. Some Devil Fruits—either due to their recent introduction in the manga or challenges in design—didn't make the cut. At present, I don't plan on expanding this Encyclopedia. However, those seeking a wider variety of Devil Fruits can either craft their own fruits or delve into the rich reservoir of homebrewed Devil Fruits courtesy of our wonderful community over at our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/2TrWf6FH5e).

### Endless Possibilities

The world of Devil Fruits is vast, and this compendium doesn't seek to limit creativity, but rather ignite it. Take these sheets as starting points for your own unique concoctions. Wish to introduce a "Candy-Candy Logia Devil Fruit" into your world? Look no further than the templates provided, such as the Hie Hie no Mi, to serve as a foundation. Your imagination is the only limit.

In the vast oceans of adventure that D&D offers, may these Devil Fruits serve as the winds to your players' sails, propelling them into stories filled with wonder, danger, and magic. Embark on this journey and let the world of One Piece meld beautifully with the realms of Dungeons & Dragons.

Fair winds and following seas, Dungeon Masters.

*Devil Fruit, Uncommon*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia

**Description.** Grants the user the ability to shrink their body to a minuscule size and return to their normal size at will. The user's strength remains the same regardless of size.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Tiny Form.** As an action, you can halve your size, and your weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal, or you can return to your normal size. This reduction decreases your size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example (down to a minimum of tiny). You can use a subsequent action in your Tiny form to further halve your size by one category. Your weapons also shrink to match your new size. While these weapons are reduced, your attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage for each size category you have decreased by (this can’t reduce the damage below 1). Your tiny form lasts for 10 minutes or until you fall unconscious.

**Shrink Resistance.** While shrunk, you are harder to hit. You gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws, but have disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**Size Stealth.** When shrunk, you can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured. You also have advantage on Stealth checks when in your shrunken state.

**Spells (Shrinking Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 5 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Expeditious Retreat (Self; 1 charge), Misty Step (2 charges), . The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Mini Field).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Reduce, without expending any charges or material components, on any number of creatures of your choice that you can see within range of the spell (no concentration required). Creatures affected by this awakening also benefit from your Shrink Resistance and Size Stealth features. You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.

**Floating Limbs.** When you divide your body, any part (except your feet) can float telekinetically up to 30 feet away from you. Appendages act similar to the Mage Hand cantrip.

**Spells (Chopping Technqiues).** This devil fruit power has 5 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Chop Chop Cannon (as Catapult, using a body part; 1 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Blur (2 charges), or Chop Chop Festival (as Conjure Barrage, but you create a storm of floating limbs; 3 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Telekinetic Carnival).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Telekinesis, without expending any charges or material components, on any number of objects or creatures of your choice that you can see within range of the spell (no concentration required), with a duration of 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. Your divided body parts can be used to increase the range or control multiple objects simultaneously. Additionally, you can telekinetically control yourself (as if using Telekinesis) for the duration, even affecting your feet. You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.

**Spike Immunity.** You are immune to nonmagical piercing damage, as your body has adapted to the nature of spikes and sharp objects.

**Impaling Strike.** As a bonus action, you can cause your next melee attack against a creature to deal an extra 1d8 piercing damage on a hit, as long spikes emerge from your attacks until the start of your next turn. If you grapple a creature, you can choose to impale them on your spikes, dealing 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns while the grapple lasts.

Additionally, your skin hardens with a protective layer of spikes, granting you resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning and slashing damage and causing melee attackers to take damage equal to half of what they deal to you.

**Spring Legs.** Your long jump is up to 20 feet and your high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start, unless your current jump distance is higher. Additionally, if you land during a fall, you can use a reaction to reduce the impact uisng your springs, and you do not take any fall damage and can land on your feet.

**Bounce Back.** Whenever you come into impact with a hard surface, such as by jumping against it or by falling onto it, you can use a bonus action during your turn to use your spring body to bounce back in the opposite direction for free using your long jump or high jump (depending on the direction you are jumping) without using any movement.

**Spring Hopper.** As an action on your turn, you can spend 3 devil fruit charges to unleash a spring assault onto your enemies. If you choose to do so, until the end of your turn, you do not provoke any opportunity attacks, you can make up to two additional long or high jumps without expending any movement to do so, and after you complete a jump, you can make a free melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet from where you land.

The door remains open until the end of your next turn or until you close it as a bonus action, after which the surface reverts to its original state. If created in mid-air, the door exclusively leads to the ethereal plane.

**Golden Hour.** You learn the Sapping Sting cantrip. When you hit a creature with sapping sting, the target's strength score is reduced by 1d4 as their strength is washed away. The target's strength score can only be reduced down to 1, at which point the target is rendered incapacitated until its strength score increases past 1. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest, or washes the bubbles off using water as an action.

**Bubble Tidal Wave.** As an action, by spending 3 devil fruit charges you can cast the Tidal Wave spell, no material components required. Any creature which fails the save also has the draining effect from your Golden Hour applied to it.

The creature can break free from a bubble it is trapped in (DC equal to your Devil Fruit save DC) or if it pops it (AC 11; Resistance to Bludgeoning, Immunity to Poison and Psychic; 5 HP). Additionally, you and allies in the area can float vertically on bubbles up to 20 feet within the zone during their turn (as if using the Levitate spell) and do not take fall damage from falling in the area.

**Rubbery Wheel Immunity.** You are immune to nonmagical bludgeoning damage, as your body bounces and rolls blunt force away from you with its wheels.

**Wheel Weaponry.** As a bonus action, you can cause your next melee attack against a creature to deal an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit, as the rotational energy from your attacks increases until the start of your next turn.

Enemies on the terrain must make a Dexterity saving throw at the start of each turn or be knocked prone and immediately moved straight in any direction of your choice up to any location within the area. For example, you could push a creature into a pit or environmental hazard within the area if they fail. You and your allies gain triple movement speed on this terrain, and your rotational attacks deal double damage and push failing targets 10 feet instead. You can't use this action again for another 24 hours.

In this orb form, your movement speed doubles, and you gain the ability to float 5 feet above the ground. Attack rolls against you have disadvantage due to your scattered form. You cannot cast spells, make weapon attacks, or otherwise attack and interact with creatures, except by using your Orb Burst Attack feature or Orb Technique spells.

**Orb Burst Attack.** While in your orb form, you can use an action to launch a barrage of orbs towards a target within 30 feet. Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage as orbs strike the target from multiple directions.

The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Orb Hurricane).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast the Whirlwind spell, without expending a spell slot or material components, which is made up of orbs being produced by the terrain around you. You can't use this action again for another 24 hours.

**Type.** Environment Alterer Paramecia

**Fruit appearance.** A light blue banana-shaped fruit, covered in white S-shaped swirls.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Wash Impurity.** You learn the mending cantrip, no material components required, as you are able to wash away any damage on items.

**Wash and Fold.** As an action, you can touch an object or creature within your reach. If the target is an object weighing up to 150 pounds, it's instantly washed and turned into a flat 2D form. If the target is a creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or be turned into a 2D form. Creatures in this form are incapacitated and have their weight reduced by 95%. You can revert any flattened form to its original state as a bonus action. A creature that saves against this effect becomes immune to it for the next 24 hours.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success, the effect ends.

**Spells (Wash Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 5 charges.

The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Laundry Realm).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to unleash a massive wave of washing energy in a 30-foot radius centered on you.

This transformation is permanent, unless removed by a Greater Restoration spell or a similar effect. Otherwise, its personality and mental ability scores remain the same. You can also determine its size (tiny to gargantuan). The creature also loses any ability to cast spells, and any special abilities it may have had in its original form. While in toy form, the creature is charmed by you and cannot harm you, and you can erase its memories while it is a toy. If you fall to 0 hit points, fall unconscious, or fall victim to your Sea Weakness, every creature under the effects of your Toy Transformation reverts back to their original form. Alternatively, a creature can be freed from this effect with the Greater Restoration or Wish spells. A creature that succeeds on saving against your Toy Transformation or is otherwise reverted back to its original form is immune to the effects of it for 24 hours.

**Contract Making.** As a bonus action, you can make a contract with a toy you have transformed. The toy obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don't involve harming you. If you are absent, the toy acts on its own to carry out your last given command.

**Spells (Toy Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 9 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Toy Servant (unseen servant; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Hold Toy (as hold person; only works on toys of any size; 2 charges), Summon Toy (summon construct; 4 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Overdrive Transformation).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cause all creatures within 30 feet of you to make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, they are transformed into toys, and are subject to the effects of your Toy Transformation and Contract Making abilities. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again for another 24 hours.

**Fruit appearance.** A dark-purple, nearly black, heart-shaped fruit with spiraled patterns running from its stem to its base.

**Description.** Grants the user the ability to manipulate shadows, stealing them from living beings, and attaching them to other entities, including inanimate objects, thereby animating them.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Shadow Thief.** As an action, you can attempt to grab the shadow of a creature within 10 feet of you, so long as it has a CR of 1/8 or higher. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or have its shadow stolen. A creature can retrieve its shadow by destroying an undead or object which holds its shadow, or by placing salt in its mouth (touch; athletics or Sleight of Hand against the undead or object's Athletics or Acrobatics), or by stealing it back from you if you are holding it (touch; athletics or Sleight of Hand against your Athletics or Acrobatics). A creature missing its shadow falls victim to a vampire's Sunlight Hypersensitivity weakness (5e Monster Manual). When you successfully steal a shadow from a creature, you gain 1 Devil Fruit charge. If a creature who has had its shadow stolen dies, you lose its shadow and thereby lose 1 devil fruit charge.

**Shadow Animate.** As an action, you can spend 1 devil fruit charge to animate a single medium or smaller sized dead creature or inanimate object (as if using animate dead or animate objects) by infusing it with a shadow you have stolen, except it has the same stats it would have if it were alive. A dead creature's CR must be equal to or less than 1 to be animated this way. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action (thus gaining 1 devil fruit charge as the shadow leaves its body) or it is destroyed (and the shadow returns to its host's body). If you wish to infuse a higher CR dead creature or larger object with shadows to animate it, you must spend a total number of charges equal to its CR (CR must be no greater than half your character level rounded up), or an additional charge for each size category the object is over medium, up to Huge (E.g. 2 charges for large, 3 for huge). 

**Shadow Asgard.** You can absorb stolen shadows into your body to become larger and more powerful. By spending 1 Devil Fruit charge, you absorb a shadow into yourself. For each shadow you absorb, you gain 10 temporary hit points (which only stacks with each additional shadow absorbed) up to a maximum of 30, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage (up to a maximum bonus of 3d4), your reach with melee weapons extends by 5 feet (up to a 15 foot total bonus), and your size increases by one (up to gargantuan). While this form is active, you have advantage on strength checks and saving throws. When you lose all temporary hit points granted by this ability, the shadows are expelled from your body and returned to its original host, and this ability ends.

**Doppelman.** You can detach your own shadow and animate it as a bonus action in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This shadow is a magical, translucent, dark image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another shadow, or until you're incapacitated.

Your shadow has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions and all damage except force and radiant damage. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the shadow to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your shadow is ever more than a mile away from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. If your Doppelman touches water or salt, it is also destroyed.

As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your shadow at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the shadow's space. You make this choice for each attack.

When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your shadow moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the shadow's space.

If your Doppelman is ever destroyed or dismissed, your shadow returns to you. While your shadow is missing, you also fall victim to the vampire's Sunlight Hypersensitivity weakness.

**Spells (Shadow Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 9 maximum charges, but you start with none. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components, with the source of the spell being yourself or your Doppelman: Shadow Arms (Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Darkness (2 charges), Shadow Blade (2 charges), Shadow Bat Barrage (Conjure Barrage; 3 charges), Evard's Black Tentacles (4 charges), Night Parade (Danse Macabre or Animate Objects; 5 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges when shadows are collected from Shadow Thief.

**Awakening (Shadow Legion).** Once you've awakened your power, you can pull shadows from all objects around you and use an action to conjure up to 10 Shadows (see the Monster Manual for statistics), for up to 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. The Shadows form in unoccupied spaces within 100 feet of you and obey your commands for 1 minute or until they are destroyed. You can dismiss one shadow as a free action during your turn, once per turn, and animate a dead creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is under your command for the duration of your awakening, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability. Once you use ability, you can't use it again for another 24 hours.

You can speak to the mirrors in this dimension, as they are sentient, asking them questions they would understand and know. These can be questions about creatures the mirror has seen, where a specific mirror leads to, or where specific mirrors are located in the dimension.

**Reflective Defense.** When hit by a melee attack, you can use your reaction and spend 5 devil fruit charges to create a mirror shield, causing the damage to become 0. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes half of the damage they would have dealt to you, as the attack is redirected back to them.

# Very Rare Devil Fruits


##### Nikyu Nikyu no Mi (Paw Repel)
*Devil Fruit, Very Rare*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia

**Fruit appearance.** A light-beige, paw-shaped fruit with swirls and dark spots across its surface.

**Description.** Grants the user the ability to repel anything they touch with their paw-padded palms, including intangible concepts such as pain and fatigue, by using the paw pads on their palms.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Paw Push.** If you take the Attack action to shove a target and push it back, you can choose to push it back 30 feet using your paw-padded palms. If a pushed target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

Additionally, you may expend additional devil fruit charges to increase the distance the creature is pushed as a part of this attack. If you do so, you push the creature back an additional 10 feet per devil fruit charge expended, up to 100 feet in total.

**Paw Cannon.** You have the ability to repel the air around you, allowing you to fire paw-shaped air shockwaves. As an action, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target within 120 feet. On a hit, the creature takes 4d6 thunder damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or be knocked prone. You can spend 1 or more devil fruit charges to increase the damage of this attack, dealing an extra 1d6 damage per charge expended, up to 12d6 total thunder damage.

**Defensive Repel.** When targeted and hit by an attack, you can use your reaction and spend 7 devil fruit charges to attempt to repel the attack, causing the damage to become 0. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes half of the damage they would have dealt to you, as the attack is redirected back to them.

**Ursus Shock.** As an action, you may spend 1 or more devil fruit charges to concentrate a large volume of air into your palms, allowing you to unleash it out as a devastating shockwave centered on a point within 120 feet that you can see. If you do so, you target each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. A creature takes 3d10 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the shockwave’s area. The shockwave's damage increases by 1d10 and it's radius increases by 5 feet for each additional devil fruit charge expended over 1, dealing up to 11d10 thunder damage and having up to a 50-foot radius in total.

**Pain Repel.** As an action, you may expend 1 or more devil fruit charges to touch a creature and repel the pain from its body. If you do so, the target creature regains 1d10 hit points for every devil fruit charge spent. This ability has no effect on undead or constructs. Additionally, the repelled pain congeals and forms into a 10-foot-radius bubble in an empty space next to the target, and stores a number of pain equal to the amount healed from the target. The bubble lasts for up to 1 hour or until it pops. As an action, you may push the bubble up to 30 feet away from you by touching it. If you push the bubble into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, and the bubble pops. The creature takes the amount of stored pain in necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Extended Travel Repel.** As an action, you can touch a creature and spend 7 devil fruit charges to attempt to teleport it to a location by repelling it at extreme speeds. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. A willing creature automatically fails this save. On a failure, the creature is teleported to a place you are aware of, landing in a random empty space in the region of the DM's choice. If no target destination is given, the target is teleported to a random location of the DM's choosing in the direction it is pushed, at least 1 mile away. On a successful save, the creature is instead repelled 30 feet away from you, as per your Paw Push ability.

**Spells (Repelling Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Misty Step (2 charges), Air Bubble (2 charges), Thunder Step (3 charges), Wind Wall (3 charges), Gravity Sinkhole (4 charges),  Destructive Wave (5 charges), Far step (5 charges), Scatter (6 charges), or Teleport (7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Extended Group Vacation).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to target up to 5 creatures within 30 feet of you, threatening to repel them at extreme speeds away from you. A target creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failure, the creature is subjected to your Extended Travel Repel feature. On a success, the creature is instead repelled up to 30 feet away from you, as per your Paw Push ability.

After using this feature, you cannot use it again for another 24 hours.

##### Kira Kira no Mi (Diamond)
*Devil Fruit, Very Rare*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia

**Fruit appearance.** A shimmering blue berry with multifaceted crystalline surfaces.

**Description.** This devil fruit empowers its user with the ability to transform or harden any part of their body into diamond.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Sharpened Diamond Body.** As a bonus action, you can transform any part of your body into a melee weapon of your choice. This can range from turning an arm into a diamond longsword, fingers into dagger-like diamond blades, or even combining your arms or legs into a diamond greatclub. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. You can use this part of your body as a weapon attack, and you are proficient with it. You can only use one weapon active this way at a time, and can dismiss it using a bonus action.

**Diamond Skin.** Your AC can’t be less than 20, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing. By spending 1 devil fruit charge as a bonus action, you can gain a +2 bonus to your AC for up to 1 minute or until you fall unconscious (this effect doesn't stack).

**Brilliant Punk.** You can spend a bonus action to bolster the next melee weapon attack you make during your turn with your diamond body. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's damage type. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone.

**Spells (Diamond Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Thunder Step (3 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Stoneskin (Self; 4 charges), Destructive Wave (5 charges), or Tenser's Transformation (6 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Brilliant Wave).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to unleash a mighty earth shockwave affecting any creature standing on the ground within 60 feet of you. Any creature hit by the shockwave must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage and 10d10 thunder damage, and is knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Additionally, immediately after you use this ability, the ground within 60 feet of you becomes extremely hard and diamond-like for 1 minute, and cannot be destroyed or affected by any spells or other effects for the duation. Once used, you can't use this action again for another 24 hours.

##### Goru Goru no Mi (Gold Manipulation)
*Devil Fruit, Very Rare*

**Type.** Environment Alterer Paramecia

**Fruit appearance.** An extremely shiny golden pear, with cloud-like spiral patterns across its surface.

**Description.** This devil fruit empowers its user with the ability to manipulate and move around massive amounts of gold telekinetically.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Chrysokinesis.** You can use the Telekinesis and Levitate spells at will, without expending a spell slot, charge, or material components. You can only target objects made of gold and creatures wearing or holding gold items using these spells this way.

**Gold Manipulation.** As an action, you can target any gold within 60 feet of you to form up to thirteen 5-foot diameter spheres worth of affected gold, allowing you to telekinetically control the gold (as if using the Telekinesis spell). You cannot have more than thirteen of these gold spheres under you control at once. You require 100,000 gold pieces or 400 gold bars (or ฿1,000,000,000 worth of gold) to form each individual 5-foot diameter sphere this way. Once you use this action, you cannot use it again for another 24 hours. 

Any gold being telekinetically controlled by this ability is considered liquid (but doesn't count against a Devil Fruit user's Sea Weakness) unless otherwise stated, and counts as difficult terrain when moved through in its liquid state. Creatures will suffocate inside liquid gold if they remain inside it. Any gold forcibly moved 60 feet away from you while being telekinetically controlled returns to an empty space you can see within 60 feet of you at the start of your next turn. Additionally, while the spheres are under your telekinetic control, you can spend an action to use one of the following effects on the gold during your turn:

- **Combine/Separate:** You can combine the volumes of the gold spheres to form a larger mass of liquefied gold with a total volume no greater than the total volumes of your currently controlled gold, or split the mass back apart into independent 5-foot diameter spheres. 

- **Slam:** You can slam a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold into a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage.

- **Armory:** You can use a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold to form any weapon or armor of your choice. You are proficient with any gold weapon or armor you use, and ignore strength requirements to use it. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. The gold cannot be controlled or used while it is used as a weapon or piece of armor, unless you reform it back into a sphere a bonus action. 

- **Bind:** You can use a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold to target a creature within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, or become restrained by the gold for 1 minute or until it breaks free (escape DC equal to your Devil Fruit save DC). The gold cannot be controlled or used while it restrains a creature, unless you free the creature from it as a bonus action.

- **Animate:** You use one sphere of gold to construct a solid Gold Golem (as Iron Golem; stats found in the standard 5th Edition Monster Manual). It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands. When it falls to 0 hit points or otherwise gets destroyed, so does the gold sphere used to construct it. You can only have one Gold Golem activate at a time, and once you create one you can't create anohter one for 24 hours.

- **Collect:** You condense the gold into tiny rings you collect, one ring per 5-foot diameter sphere of gold. You gain 1 devil fruit charge per ring collected, not exceeding 13 total charges, but can no longer affect the collected gold telepathically using your Gold Manipulation feature until you re-activate the feature.


**Spells (Golden Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 13 maximum charges, but you start with none. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Golden Burst (as Thunderous Smite; 1 charge), Golden Arms (as Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Gold Wave (as Tidal Wave, made of liquid gold; 3 charges), Golden Tentacles (as Evard's Black Tentacles; 4 charges), Golden Hand (as Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), Golden Wall (as Wall of Stone; 5 charges), Flesh to Gold (as Flesh to Stone; 6 charges), and Golden Inferno (as Firestorm; 7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges when you use your "Collect" ability. All material created using these spells return back to the original gold value used to create the devil fruit charges to fuel it after the spell's duration ends.

**Awakening (Gold Splash).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily alchemically manifest gold from the environment, which you can control telepathically. When you do so, you can use this gold to cast Tsunami, with a 1 action casting time. After the Tsunami ends, the gold returns back to mundane, nonmagical materials. Once used, you can't use this action again for another 24 hours.






CHAPTER 3 | VERY RARE PARAMECIA

##### Mochi Mochi no Mi (Mochi)
*Devil Fruit, Very Rare*

**Type.** Special Paramecia

**Fruit appearance.** A creamy white fruit with a swirl pattern across its surface. It appears to have a pinched off, flattened foot toward the bottom of it.

**Description.** This devil fruit allows the user to create, control, and transform into mochi

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Mochi Body.** You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, as physical objects pass through your mochi body. Additionally, you can move across Difficult Terrain created by mochi or sticky surfaces without spending extra Movement.

**Mochi Creation.** As a mochi being, you are able to produce and control mochi in various ways. Any mochi produced with this devil fruit is thick and viscous enough to not be considered water to devil fruit users, but creatures fully submerged in mochi will suffocate and drown normally as if they are underwater. You are immune to suffocating in your own mochi.

You can spend 1 devil fruit charge to cast create or destroy water as a 1st-level spell slot, without expending a spell slot or material components. Instead of producing or destroying water with this spell, you produce or destroy edible mochi that is much thicker than water in the same amount and volume. This mochi counts as food when consumed, but spoils after 24 hours. You may spend additional devil fruit charges to increase the level of this spell by 1 for every charge expended as a part of casting the spell. Additionally, you learn and can use the Shape Water cantrip on this mochi.

Additionally, you can spend a bonus action to harden the mochi into a solid block of mochi which can expand up to a 10-by-10 ft cube, but counts as the same amount of food. A creature in the mochi's space when it expands is pushed out safely to the nearest space.

**Mochi Reach.** You learn the mage hand cantrip. Additionally, when you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can make its reach extend up to 30 feet by stretching your mochi limbs.

**Mochi Weapon.** As a bonus action, you can transform any part of your body into a melee weapon of your choice. This can range from turning an arm into a longsword, fingers into dagger-like blades, or even combining your arms or legs into a greatclub. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. You can use this part of your body as a weapon attack, and you are proficient with it. You can only use one weapon active this way at a time, and can dismiss it using a bonus action. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon created this way while it is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or become grappled by you as it sticks to the mochi surface.

**Spells (Mochi Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Buzz Cut Mochi (as Zephyr Strike; 1 charge), Willow Mochi (as Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Burning Mochi (as Scorching Ray; 2 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Mochi Grasp (as Maximillian's Earthen Grasp; 2 charges), Wall of Mochi (as Wall of Water, but made of mochi; 3 charges), Mochi Tentacles (as Evard's Black Tentacles; 4 charges), Mochi Hand (Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), or Mochi Shield (as Fizban's Platinum Shield; Self; 6 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Unstoppable Donuts).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily manifest large amounts of concentrated mochi from the environment, which you can control telepathically to create two floating fists which emerge from mochi donuts. When you do so, the two large hands appear within 120 feet of you at a point you can see, which act as Bigby's Hand (no concentration required), and last for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. You can use an action on your turn to create an additional hand this way, which appears within 120 feet of you, and lasts until the duration of this ability ends. As a bonus action, you can move and act with any number of mochi hands you control at once, as per the spell description of Bigby's Hand for each. Once used, you can't use this awakening again for another 24 hours.

##### Bari Bari no Mi (Barrier)
*Devil Fruit, Very Rare*

**Type.** Substance Generator Paramecia

**Fruit appearance.** An emerald green melon with a swirl pattern across its surface and a crescent-shaped stem. Its surface is extremely hard, and very difficult to bite through.

**Description.** This devil fruit allows the user to create and manipulate magical barriers made of force.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Barrier Creation.** As an action, you can cast Wall of Force at will without expending a spell slot, charges, or material components. However, when you cast it using this feature, you can only produce one 10-by-10 foot panel or a 5-foot diameter sphere centered on you with it.

**Barrier Crash.** While concentrating on a Wall of Force barrier you have created using this devil fruit power, you can spend an action to push it up to 30 feet in any direction, or until it collides with an unmovable object or terrain. Anything in the path of the moving barrier must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, as the barrier slams against it. On a failure, the target is knocked prone, takes 2d8 force damage, and is pushed by the barrier up to the total distance you move it. On a success, it is only pushed by the barrier. If a creature is squished between your barrier and another object and fails the saving throw, it instead takes 4d8 force damage and is restrained until it breaks free (escape DC equal to your Devil Fruit save DC). On a success or if the creature breaks free, it is pushed out to the nearest empty space that your barrier isn't pushing against.

**Barrierbility.** As an action, you can manipulate any active Wall of Force you have created to rearrange its panels into a shape of your choice, so long as each panel is still connected to another panel. For example, you can reform it into a staircase with each step being an individual panel of the wall. Any creature or object in the path of the shifting wall is not pushed or damaged by it.

**Barrier Fist.** Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 devil fruit charge to deal an 2d8 force damage to the target, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or you can knock it prone. You can expend additional devil fruit charges to deal another 1d8 force damage per additional charge expended, up to a total of 10d8 force damage.

**Spells (Barrier Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere (4 charges), Wall of Force (5 charges), Barrier Hand (as Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), or Forcecage (7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Gigabarrier).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily manifest large amounts of energy from the environment, which you can then form and reshape into a massive barrier. When you do so, you cast a special Wall of Force, without expending a spell slot or material components. This special wall of force can have up to a hundred panels, and its radius is up to 100 feet instead. Once used, you can't use this awakening again for another 24 hours.

##### Jiki Jiki no Mi (Magnetism)
*Devil Fruit, Very Rare*

**Type.** Environment Alterer Paramecia

**Fruit appearance.** A stainless steel fruit with tons of bolt-shaped barbs and cloud-like swirls across its surface. It has a yellow coil wrapping around it up to the stem, which appears like a bolt of lightning.

**Description.** This devil fruit allows the user to control the magnetism and control metallic objects using magnetic forces.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Magnetokinesis.** You can use the Telekinesis and Levitate spells at will, without expending a spell slot, charge, or material components. You can only target objects made of metal and creatures wearing or holding metal or metallic items using these spells this way.

**Magnetic Repel.** When targeted and hit by an attack from a weapon or ammo which is made of metal, you can use your reaction and spend 7 devil fruit charges to attempt to repel the attack, causing the damage to become 0. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes half of the damage they would have dealt to you, as the attack is redirected back to them.

**Magnetic Assembly.** As an action, you can attract a large amount of metal within 120 feet of you toward your body to assemble onto your body. You must spend 1 devil fruit charge for every 5-foot square of metal you attract and assemble onto your body. For each square of metal you assemble onto you, you gain 10 temporary hit points (which only stacks with each additional shadow absorbed) up to a maximum of 30, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage (up to a maximum bonus of 3d4), your reach with melee weapons extends by 5 feet (up to a 15 foot total bonus), and your size increases by one (up to gargantuan). While this form is active, you have advantage on strength checks and saving throws. When you lose all temporary hit points granted by this ability, the metal you assembled is destroyed, and this ability ends.

**Electromagnetic Cannon.** As an action, you can spend 3 devil fruit charges to create a large electromagnetic cannon from metal around you. When you do so, you can fire a beam of electromagnetic energy forming a line of 100 feet long and 5 feet wide out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. A creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save and is pushed back 20 feet away from you, or half as much damage on a successful one and isn't pushed. You can spend additional devil fruit charges to increase the bludgeoning damage by 1d6 and the push distance by 10 feet for each additional charge spent, up to a total of 12d6 bludgeoning damage and 80 feet.

**Spells (Magnetic Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Catapult (targeting metal; 1 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Cloud of Daggers (2 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Fly (Self; 3 charges), Conjure Barrage (3 charges), Conjure Volley (5 charges), Scrap Metal Hand (as Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), Blade Barrier (6 charges), or Reverse Gravity (only affecting metallic objects and creatures wearing metal; 7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.

**Awakening (Magnetic Assignment).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to mark two targets, which can be objects or creatures you can see within 120 feet of you, which causes them to become magnetically attracted to each other, even if they aren't made of metal or wearing metal. This magnetic attraction lasts for 1 minute, or until you fall unconscious. While these two targets are magnetically attracted to each other this way, each target at the start of each of its turns must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save. On a failure, it is magnetically pulled up to 120 feet toward the other target, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled, unless the target is already within 5 feet of it. A target that is slammed into by an object or creature this way must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the same damage on a failure or half as much on a success. Alternatively, you may force a target that fails its strength saving throw on its turn to be pushed away from the other target, up to a 120 foot gap between the two targets. If it is pushed away this way and crashes into an object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled from the crash.

Additionally, you may spend an action on subsequent turns for the duration to cause metalic objects in the area to crash into a target you have marked this way, forcing the target to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. If both marked targets are within 5 feet of each other, both must make this saving throw.

Once used, you can't use this awakening again for another 24 hours.

**Poison Hydra Heads.** As an action, you can expend 3 devil fruit charges to create three giant poisonous hydra heads which connect to your body. These heads last for 1 minute and require concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) to maintain. You can use a bonus action to send one of the hydra heads crashing toward one creature or object you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d12 poison damage. Whether you hit or miss, the head is expended. This ability ends early if all heads are expended.

# Legendary Devil Fruits


##### Ope Ope no Mi (Surgery) Part 1
*Devil Fruit, Legendary*

**Type.** Environment Alterer Paramecia
	
**Fruit appearance.** A red heart-shaped melon with swirls
	
**Description.** Allows the user to create a zone of control around them that they can manipulate in a variety of ways.
	
**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Counter Shock & Room.** You learn the Shocking Grasp cantrip. Additionally, you can use a bonus action to create a 60-foot radius psychic sphere, or "room", centered on where you are standing when you create it. You must maintain concentration on this room (as if concentrating on a spell). The room lasts for 1 minute, or until you end it using a bonus action. You can only have one room up at a time. Each turn, you can use an another bonus action to increase the radius of the room by another 60 feet. Any creature you can see within the room can be targeted by any leveled spell casted using this devil fruit under "Room Spells", regardless of spell range. Additionally, the range of spells or any spell effect listed in "room spells" can be extended to anywhere within the "room", but is also limited by the range of the room and cannot be cast outside it or affect anything outside the room's radius. For example, misty step's range increases from 60 feet up to the range of anywhere within the room's radius. Room Spells which normally require concentration don't require concentration while cast within the Room's radius, but will end when the Room's duration ends or when you lose concentration on the room.

You can spend an action to Scan the radius of your room to spot a creature you are aware of that is behind full cover or hidden within the room's range. You can do this by rolling a perception check against the creature's stealth to locate it. A creature spotted this way cannot gain the benefits of full cover against your Devil Fruit Spells while within the room's range, and can be seen by you as if they were fully visible, becoming outlined by Faerie Fire.

**Surgery Scalpel.** As an action, you can designate a melee weapon you are proficient with that deals slashing or piercing damage as your Surgery Scalpel when using your Ope Ope no Mi powers. The weapon becomes magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance if it isn't already. Additionally, when you hit a creature within your Room with your Surgery Scalpel, once per turn you can forego dealing damage and instead use one of the following effects against the target:

- **Injection Shot:** You can spend 1 devil fruit charge to deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage to the target with your Surgery Scalpel.

- **Gamma Knife:** You can spend 3 devil fruit charges to deal an extra 3d8 radiant damage to the target with your Surgery Scalpel. Additionally, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the condition on a success.

- **Amputate:** You cleanly slice off one of the creature's limbs for 10 minutes, but dealing no harm to it in the process. Each time you remove a creature's limbs this way, it gains a level of exhaustion (up to a maximum of 5 levels of exhaustion) so long as the limbs aren't attached. A creature that has had its limbs removed this way can spend an action to re-attach all its limbs, ending all levels of exhaustion applied by the amputation on itself. You can spend 1 devil fruit charge when using this attack during your turn to apply "Radio Knife" to the Amputation, dealing 1d8 electric damage to the target, and causing the creature to become unable to re-attach it's missing limb unless its succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC as a part of its action to re-attach its limbs. If the creature fails the saving throw, its action is wasted and its limbs remain unattached.


**Shambles.** You can target two creatures or objects, including yourself, within your "room" as an action. The two targets magically teleport to each other's spaces and swap places.

**Immortality Surgery.** By spending 10 minutes operating on another creature, you grant it immortality. The target stops aging. It is immune to any effect that would age it, and it can't die from old age. However, you will die and be reduced to dust upon completing this surgery.
	
**Room Spells.** This devil fruit power has 17 charges. While within the "room", you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: catapult (1 charge, can be cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), detect poison and disease (1 charge), cure wounds (1 charge, can be cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), find traps (2 charges), hold person (2 charges, can be cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), levitate (2 charges), silence (2 charges), see invisibility (only within room; 2 charges), vortex warp (2 charges), gravity sinkhole (4 charges), hold monster (5 charges), mass cure wounds (5 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), move earth (6 charges), whirlwind (7 charges), or tether essence (7 charges).

**Awakening (K-ROOM and R-ROOM).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to activate K-ROOM or R-ROOM, or use an action to alternate between the two, ending any currently active Rooms. You can use either of these special rooms for 1 minute after activating your awakening (but cannot activate your regular Room or both at the same time), or until you fall unconscious, and they do not require concentration to maintain:

- **K-ROOM:** You apply your Room to your designated Surgery Scalpel as a special coating for the duration. While this special Room is active, your Surgery Scalpel weapon's reach becomes 60 feet. You can use a bonus action while your K-ROOM coating is active to extend your Surgery Scalpel's reach by an additional 60 feet. Additionally, when you hit a creature with K-ROOM coated Surgery Scalpel, once per turn you can forego dealing damage and instead use one of the following effects against the target:
 - **Shock Surge:** You send a deadly shock through the target, dealing 10d10 lightning damage to it.
 - **Puncture Surge:** The target is pushed away from you to the end of your weapon's reach and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed. If the target is pushed into another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
 
- **R-ROOM:** You apply your Room to a target within 120 feet of you. The room is a 10-foot-radius sphere which surrounds the target. Until the duration ends, the sphere moves with the target, centered on it. This room acts as an Antimagic Field spell.

The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or the creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. A creature that is frightened of you has disadvantage on this saving throw. If a creature is immune to the frightened condition or necrotic damage, it is not affected by this ability. This reduction is permanent, unless a Greater Restoration, Heal, or Wish spell is used on the target. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

The Soul Monster is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

Once used, you can’t activate your awakening again for another 24 hours.

##### Zushi Zushi no Mi (Gravity)
*Devil Fruit, Legendary*

**Type.** Environment Alterer Paramecia
	
**Fruit appearance.** An unusually heavy dark gray melon with purple cracks and ripples along its surface.
	
**Description.** Allows the user to create and manipulate gravitational forces.
	
**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.
	
**Gravity Control.** You learn the Sapping Sting cantrip, no material components required. Additionally, you can cast magnify gravity (1st level) as an action, no charges required. You can cast it at higher levels by spending a devil fruit charge for each additional level the spell is cast at.

**Gravity Wave.** As an action, you can spend 3 devil fruit charges to emit a large wave of enhanced gravity. When you do so, you can fire a wave of gravitational energy forming a line of 100 feet long and 5 feet wide out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save and is knocked prone, or half as much damage on a successful one and isn't knocked prone. You can spend additional devil fruit charges to increase the force damage by 1d6, up to a total of 12d6 force damage.

**Spells (Gravity Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 17 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: immovable object (2 charges, can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), levitate (2 charges), pulse wave (3 charges), gravity sinkhole (4 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), gravity fissure (6 charges), reverse gravity (7 charges), dark star (8 charges), or meteor swarm (9 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.
	
**Awakening (Extreme Gravity Field).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to create a 60-foot radius gravity aura around you for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. When you activate this aura, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d8 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. While in the aura, any object that isn't being worn or carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your spell save DC to pick up or move. Ranged attacks made against you and any creature within this field are made at disadvantage. Once used, you can’t activate your awakening again for another 24 hours.

**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Permanent Levitation.** As an action, you can touch any object that isn't being worn or held, or up to a 20-foot cube of terrain, and cause it to levitate up to 20 feet in the air (as if using the levitate spell) at will, no concentration required, and regardless of its weight. You can move one object you are levitating up to 20 feet during your turn. You can cause multiple objects to permanently levitate this way, and can end this levitation effect on any number of them as a bonus action. If you fall unconscious, every object you are levitating this way loses its levitating properties and begins to fall if it is midair, unless you command them to levitate again as an action.

**Bodily Levitation.** You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and hover mid-air.

**Spells (Floating Techniques).** This devil fruit power has 17 charges.

The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn. These spells only work on objects or regions of terrain you have touched before.
	
**Awakening (Float Zone).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to create a 120-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. Any creature or object within this sphere can be targeted by any of your Devil Fruit spells for the duration, even if you haven't touched them before. Additionally, if a creature starts its turn in the sphere or enters it for the first time during its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is levitated 20 feet in the air (as if affected by the Levitate spell), and has its movement halved for the rest of its turn. Once used, you can’t activate your awakening again for another 24 hours.
