# Chapter 1: Islands

Because the world of one piece is made up of an innumerable quantity of small islands spread out between a few large islands, islands will be used for a large part of the land exploration portion of each campaign. Islands in the Four Blues and Grand Line may vary in size, climate, and culture, with the latter having much more variety and extremes between each. 

Discovering new islands will provide player crews with information, quests, resources, and possible adventure and treasure. Island generation will be vital to keeping players occupied when docking and exploring between sea travel (See the "Ships and Sailing" section for more information on sea travel). 

## Island Generation

To easily create an island, the DM might decide to come up with an concept on their own or generate one randomly. In either case, using the tables and guide below will help aid in the process of generating islands for one's own campaign.

### Measuring an Island

The size of an island might range from less than a square mile to thousands of square miles in size in the Four Blue Seas. When entering the Grand Line, Red Line aside, most islands are much smaller than the continent-sized islands found in the Four Blues. For comparison and scale, you might consider making the size of islands throughout most regions of the One Piece world similar in size or population to the variety of islands in the Bahamas or Caribbean on Earth.

Use the Island Size table below to determine what size the island might be.


Island Size



1d6

Large
5d10 x 100 Sq. Miles
10d10 x 1,000 Citizens


6
Colossal
> 10,000 Sq. Miles
> 1 million citizens








### Island Terrain and Climate

The terrain of an island determines the physical features and the climate it may have. On the Grand Line, the terrain type of each island is usually static and the season remains the same year-round. Larger islands may have several types of terrain or climate across, so roll multiple times if this is the case. Use the table below to determine terrain and climate.

```
```



### Island Seasons

The seasons of each island outside the grand line is dependent on its location and climate, but will usually rotate normally between Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter. In the grand line, however, seasons may remain static or change rapidly at a highly unusual rate. For example, some islands may rotate between seasons every week.

To determine the current season on an island, you may roll a 1d4 (1 - Spring, 2 - Summer, 3 - Fall, 4 - Winter) and use the result. You might decide islands on the grand line have extreme climate changes as a result of each season as well. For example, a Jungle Island might be perpetually stuck in winter, making it a highly unusual Frost Jungle Island.

## Society and Culture

The populations of each island may have a variety of different races, belief systems, ethnicities, culture, and alignments. Alongside these factors, the level of support an island has for pirates versus the navy or world government may also differ. To determine how to run each island's society and culture, use this section as a guide.

### Races

Most islands throughout the world are inhabited and ruled by humans, with other races occasionally making up the small minority of an island's population. However, occasionally there can be rare and hidden islands inhabited by non-human races found in the grand line or other corners of the planet. Roll a 1d20 for each island, and on a roll of 1 the island is inhabited by one of the races on the table below.

*Human variants may be similar to humans, but have distinct characteristics that make them slightly different. For example, the Kuja Tribe, Torino Tribe, and Kumate Tribe are basically humans with very extreme differences in appearance and behavior.

### Cities and Settlements

Since the One Piece world is so divided and disconnected, the culture and apparent time era of each island may also vary greatly across regions. Unless an island is uninhabited, a city will usually have a number of settlements equal to each size the island is over "Small" (at least 1), but it is ultimately up to the DM.

Use the table below to determine the settlement's culture. You may use multiple different cultures or combine cultures together to create unique populations of people.

### Island Faction and Military

If an island's size is "small" or larger, it usually requires a military of some sort to defend against invaders. Some islands are defenseless, however, and rely on defending themselves against pirate and raiders. If an island is controlled by a certain faction (e.g. pirates or marines), it tends to have a certain alignment and level of support for that faction based on how the citizens are treated by said faction.

The alignment of an island's general populace is determined by what faction influences it. There are rare exceptions to this rule, however. Sometimes lawful pirates or evil marines may take control over an island, changing the island's alignment to whatever fits at the DM's discretion.

The level of support an island's population has for the ruling faction is randomly determined. If 60% or more of an island's population supports the faction controlling it, the population is considered to be in favor of their rule. If 40% of the population or less support the faction, the faction is generally disliked by the island. Any percentage in-between means the island feels generally indifferent or neutral toward the ruling faction.

Roll on the table below to determine what type of faction and military controls or protects an island.

6

#### Military Bases

If an island is controlled by a faction military, it will have at least one fortress near any settlements or cities on the island. Marines, World Government, and independent militaries will normally have a fortress or barracks, pirates will have a cove, and revolutionaries will operate in a hidden or secret base.

The number of units a faction has in its forces is determined by the population of the island. Roughly 10% of the island's total population will be members of its ruling faction. These faction members are able to fight and serve the faction its supporters at any given time.

In addition, the number and size of the faction's bases and ships can be determined by the overall number of faciton members on the island. For example, use crew size of a ship under the "Ships and Sailing" section to estimate how many ships and what size of ship would be needed to mobilize the faction members on an island. 

## Player Reputation & Intrigue

Sometimes players attempting to befriend an island's populace isn't so easy, especially if there are alignment differences between the players crew and an island. Additionally, if an island's faction members are directly opposed to the faction the players are a part of (e.g. marines hate pirates and vice versa), they may attempt to locate and capture the players. And if the player crew has a bad enough reputation on an island, they may launch an all-out witch hunt or assault onto the players after some time.

### Reputation

As mentioned in chapter 4 of the Unofficial One Piece D&D Player's Guide under the "Inspiration Dice Alternative: Pirate Prestige" section, a crew will normally enter each island with a certain level of reputation. 

The reputation score a crew starts at on an island that isn't in direct opposition to them is 5. This number increases by 1 for each famous and well-liked character on the crew (e.g. celebrity or world-class performer). If the island is ruled by a faction that directly opposes the players, their reputation score starts at 1. The only way to get crew reputation score up past 1 is by spending a week undetected by enemy faction members on the island, in which case crew reputation score increases to 2, or by swaying the minds of locals through the completion of quests done for them or by defending against invaders. See "Increasing Reputation" for more information on this.


Player Reputation

Maximum Reputation




Diminutive to Small
20


Medium
30


Large
50


Colossal
100








#### Increasing Reputation

To further increase the crew's reputation on an island, the crew can use "Pirate Prestige" abilities and points to automatically increase their reputation if their current reputation score is above 1.

Another way to increase reputation is to complete quests for local or defend against invaders. For every quest completed by a player character, their crew's reputation score increases by 1d6. If a player crew successfully defends an island from pirates, marines, or enemy invaders, the crew's reputation score increases by 10. 

#### Using Reputation

Reputation has many uses when the crew has a high reputation score on an island. If a crew's reputation is 1, they will be unable to use reputation points at all. If a crew's reputation score is higher than 10, they can spend 1 reputation point to ask for a small favor from locals or friendly faction members on the island. For larger favors, 5 or more points will need to be expended. 

If a crew has a reputation score equal to more than half of the maximum of an island, players can stage citizen revolution against an enemy faction if the population isn't in favor of its ruling faction. In exchange, the population will demand protection against invaders from the player crew. If the revolution succeeds, the ruling faction is overthrown and the island will begin flying the player crew's flag.

# Chapter 2: Ships and Sailing

This section borrows heavily from the Wizards of the Coast UA "Of Ships and the Sea" document. Detailed here is all the information you might need to use for ship creation, ship stats, and mechanics on seafaring, travel, and ship combat. Prices of ships and additional details are given in Chapter 5 of the Unofficial One Piece D&D Player's Guide.

## Ship Stat Blocks

A ship's stats provide information that can be used for combat and defensive or offensive capabilities. While unmanned or without a crew, a ship cannot take actions or use offensive abilities unless specific exceptions are made.

### Basic Statistics

#### Size

Ships can range in size from Large to Gargantuan. A ship that is between 10 and 14 feet in length or width would be counted as large vessel, a ship that is between 15 and 19 feet in length or width would be counted as huge vessel, and a ship equal to or larger than 20 feet would be counted as a gargantuan vessel. 

#### Space
A ship doesn't have a square space unless its stat block specifies otherwise. For example, a ship that is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide occupies a 20-by-10-foot space.

A ship can't move into a space that is too small to accomodate it. If it tries to do so, it crashes, as described later in the "Crashing" section.

#### Crew Maximum
A ship's stat block determines how many crew members it needs to run the ship efficiently. This assumes crew members are medium or smaller creatures. If a creature is large, it counts as four crew members. If a creature is huge, it counts as nine crew members. If a creature is gargantuan, it counts as 20 crew members or more (up to DM discretion). 

Fuel engines are another way to automate your ship's functions without a need for a large crew. Fuel engines fill a certain number of crew slots based on its type (See "Ship Upgrades"), however they also require fuel to function (See "Fueling Your Ship").

Any additional crew members over the crew maximum are counted as passengers. If the ship holds more than the crew max and passenger limit, the ship becomes cramped and all movement on the ship is halved for the duration that it remains cramped. Creatures may also be pushed off the ship, suffocated, or trampled while the ship is cramped.

#### Capacity
Indicated by the ship's stat block, the capcity of a ship determines how much cargo and creature weight it can carry. Once over weight capacity, the ship will move at half speed, rolls made to maneuver the boat will be made at disadvantage, and it may possibly capsize.

#### Upgrade Slots

The number of upgrade slots that can be used on a ship is determined by its stat block. Upgrade components can be added when a ship has upgrade slots available (See "Ship Upgrades"). Additional upgrade slots can be added during the ship's initial construction.

#### Special Vehicles

Special vehicles are rare vehicles indicated by their type on their stat block. These vehicles are typically either exotic, extremely powerful, or limited in number, making them far more difficult to find. Special vehicles cannot be purchased from ordinary vendors, and are only available for sale in specific locations determined by the DM.

##### Blueprints

To build special vehicles or special components, blueprints will be required before attempting the building process. Blueprints might be found in certain locations or be available for high prices or in exchange for favors from specific NPCs, determined by the DM.

```
```



#### Ability Scores

A ship has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers.

A ship's strength represents its size and weight. Dexterity represents a ship's ease of handling. A ship's constitution covers it durability and the quality of its construction. Ships will typically have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma unless it becomes sentient over time as the crew bonds it with or lends it a devil fruit.

If a ship has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score.

#### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

A ship's vulnerabilities, resistances, and Immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block. Typically ships will be immune to poison and psychic damage. A sentient ship may be capable of taking psychic damage, however. Ships crafted from metal or stone are also normally immune to necrotic damage. They are also immune to the following conditions unless they are sentient (in which case, the DM chooses which immunities to apply): blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, and unconscious. 

#### Sentience

A ship will become sentient if it consumes a zoan-type devil fruit, becomes influenced by the effects of a devil fruit that might grant it sentience, or develops a soul from the love of its crew. 

A ship will slowly develop a soul as its crew bonds with it over several voyages between islands. At the end of each voyage, every member of the crew must roll a Charisma check (DC 10 for a Large or Huge ship, DC 15 for a Gargantuan ship, and DC 20 for a Battleship). If more than half of the crew succeeds on this check, then the entire check is considered a success. After 3 total successes, the ship begins to develop a soul (see below). The DM may choose to withhold what these rolls are being used for.

Alternatively, the ship may develop a soul or personality from eating a zoan-type devil fruit. By feeding a devil fruit to a ship, it will become sentient in the same way it would be listed above.

Once the ship becomes sentient, it may begin speaking telepathically with its crew or others boarding it. However, because it is likely to be infantile at first, it won't be noticeably intelligent, aware, or charismatic. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores are all set to 8. While these scores are set to 8, the ship will only be able to form simple sentences and possesses a limited vocabulary based on what words it learns from its crew.

Starting from the point it becomes sentient, the ship will also be able to grow with its crew along the journey. Each time the crew levels up from here on out, so does the ship. While boarding the ship after the crew has leveled up at least once, the crew will be able to spend ability score points (2 per level up since the crew last boarded the ship) to increase the ship's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores.

In addition, the ship can be given inspiration dice at the start of each voyage or whenever the DM decides. This inspiration dice may be used to allow for a re-roll on any ability check or saving throw made by the ship.

##### Sentient Skills
While the ship is sentient it can use a number of different skills on its own without needing to be operated or boarded by a crew:

**Rescue Crew (Intelligence 12 or higher).** A sentient ship that knows its crew is in danger will attempt to sail itself to go save them. Whether it succeeds in doing so depends on the skill checks made by the ship to do so (determined by the DM). This can only be done once per day.

**Supernatural Awareness (Wisdom 12 or higher).** A sentient ship is roughly aware of who enters and leaves the ship at all times. It can use this awareness to inform its crew if any creature might be sneaking around on the ship or of any potential sabotage. How precise this awareness is depends on the Wisdom score of the ship and any Wisdom checks made by the ship.

**Inspiring Chant (Charisma 12 or higher).** A sentient ship that has developed a deep bond with its crew is able to inspire and push them to their limits. If a crew member is within 30 feet of the ship, the ship may use an action on its own to help motivate and inspire them. The inspired crew member gains advantage on the next ability check they make. This can be used a number of times equal to the captain's proficiency modifier, and it regains all uses once the crew completes a long rest.






CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING

\page

### Components

A ship is composed of different components:

**Hull.** A ship's hull is its basic frame, on which the other components are mounted.

**Control.** A control component is used to steer a ship.

**Movement.** A movement component is the element of the ship that enables it to move, such as a set of sails or oars.

**Weapon.** A ship capable of being used in combat has one or more weapon components, each of which is operated separately.

A ship's components might have special rules, as described in the stat block.

#### Armor Class

A component has an Armor Class. Its AC is meant to reflect its size, the materials used to construct it, and any defensive plating or armor used to augment its toughness.

#### Hit Points

A ship component is destroyed and becomes unusable when it drops to 0 hit points. A ship is wrecked if its hull is destroyed. 

A ship component does not have Hit Dice.

#### Damage Threshold

If a ship component has a damage threshold, that threshold appears after its hit points. A component has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the component's hit points.

### Building a Ship

If a crew desires, they may choose to build a ship or vehicle of their own with the help of a shipwright or shipbuilder. In any case, a shipwright that is proficient in managing or building vehicles will be able to spend a number of days building and assembling their dream ship. 

The cost of building a ship will be equal to 80% of the listed cost of the desired ship type, since the price of labor is taken off the total and only the materials, parts, and special tools need to be purchased. If the ship is listed as a "special vehicle", a shipwright cannot build it until they have acquired the blueprints or any special materials required to do so. Additionally, building a special vehicle requires paying 100% of the listed cost instead.

The process of building a ship can be long, strenuous, and risky. Many mishaps may happen, and whole parts can break or might even require replacements. However, the upside of building a ship is that if it is properly crafted by a superior shipwright, it will look and function even greater than an average ship of its type. 

#### Building process
Once all the required parts and materials are gathered in one place, a proficient shipwright or shipbuilder will be able to begin the ship building process:

The time it takes to build the ship is determined by the Constitution score of the type of desired vehicle on its stat block. If the constitution score is 11 or less, it will take 1 day to build. If the constitution score is 12 or 13, it will take 1 week to build. If the constitution score is 14 to 17, it will take a month and an additional month for each point over 14 to build. If the Constitution score is 18 or higher, it will take a year plus an additional year for each point over 18 to build. This time is halved for each additional proficient shipwright or shipbuilder that helps work on the vehicle until completion.

The construction period is considered downtime, but most of this downtime must be spent working on the ship each day. During this time, a number of skill checks must be made by the head shipwright to determine how successful the construction process is. The number of successful checks that need to be made is equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier on its stat block. The DC of each check is equal to the Constitution score of the vehicle (Minimum of DC 10). Each additional shipwright or shipbuilder working on the ship adds a +1 bonus to these checks (maximum of +5). These checks cannot be changed or given advantage/disadvantage by short-term skills or other abilities unless they are specifically related to the process of the shipbuilding, as it involves many different actions being done over a long period of time.

If a successful check is made, one success is counted. A critical success counts as 2 successes. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, it is a major success and you may roll on the "Major Shipbuilding Success" table to decide what buffs are applied to a random ship component.

If the check fails, one failure is counted. A critical failure is counted as 2 failures. If the check fails by 5 or more, it is a major failure and you must roll on the "Major Shipbuilding Failure" table to determine what penalties are applied to a random ship component. Once a component accumulates 3 or more major failures, it falls to 0 hit points and needs to be repaired. If 3 total failed checks or more are counted, the ship needs to be rebuilt from scratch all over again, effectively doubling the building time.

Once a number of successes equal to the 1 + the ship's Constitution modifier are counted over the total course of the required building period, the ship is finished and ready for use (using the stat blocks below).


Major Shipbuilding Success Table

Hard Material: Component gains 1d4 bonus to its damage threshold


2
Dense Coating: Component gains a +1 bonus to AC (Max 20)


3
Well-Assembled: Component gains 1d12 maximum hit points.


4
Flawless Design: Any critical hit against the component becomes a normal hit.

## Ship Upgrades

In addition to being able to build a ship, skilled shipwrights may be able to add additional components or weapons to their ship. Upgrade components may vary in price, especially if they are rare. However, sample prices are provided for each upgrade component. Additionally, a crew will need to pay a shipbuilder to upgrade their ship with a new component unless they have access to a shipwright on their crew. A shipwright will be proficient in any checks required to upgrade the ship with a new component. 

Building a component from scratch requires paying its component cost in tools and materials. Special components and their materials aren't normally available for purchase from common shops or shipyards. Building individual special components requires special knowledge or blueprints of the component and rare materials.

Upgrading a ship requires the ship to have empty upgrade slots available. If the ship stat block does not list it has any upgrade slots available, it will not be possible to add new components to it unless the upgrade component states otherwise. Alternatively, a currently existing component on a ship can be replaced with an upgrade component. A currently existing component frees 1 upgrade slot when removed or can be replaced by an identical component. The hull can not be replaced on a ship if it has already been assembled, but can be added during the construction process by adding the upgrade cost to the total ship construction cost.


#### Installing Upgrades

If a ship is taken to a shipyard, a shipbuilder will always succeed on upgrading the ship. If the ship is being upgraded by a shipwright in the crew, they will be able to undergo the upgrading process to add a new component.

The upgrading process requires a set amount of downtime for the shipwright to work on the ship and install the upgrade components. The time it takes to upgrade the ship with the component is determined by the component type and how successful the shipwright is in installing the part. When a check is made to install a part, the roll must succeed on the DC listed by the component. The type of check is determined by the skill needed to add to the component (a cannon might require a strength check to carry and place, sails may require a dexterity check to properly align, etc.) and a shipwright will always add their proficiency bonus to these rolls.

If a successful check is made, the upgrade component is added to the ship with no issues. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, or is a critical success, you may roll on the "Major Shipbuilding Success" table to decide what buffs are applied to the component. You cannot have more than 3 major successes on a component.

If the check fails, the upgrade component is not added to the ship. Instead, the time spent adding the component is wasted and another check must be made. If the check fails by 5 or more, or is a critical fail, you must roll on the "Major Shipbuilding Failure" table to determine what penalties are applied to the component. If the component receives 3 major failure penalties, the component drops to 0 hit points and needs to be repaired.

For each additional shipwright working on the ship there is a +1 bonus made to any checks to install an upgrade component, up to a maximum of +5.

**Medium components.** A medium component takes 1 hour for each check to install, and requires one successful DC check for each upgrade slot.

**Large components.** A large component takes 8 hours for each check to install, and requires one successful DC check for each upgrade slot.

**Huge components.** A huge component takes 1 day for each check to install, and requires one successful DC checks for each upgrade slot.

**Gargantuan components.** A gargantuan component takes 1 day for each check to install, and requires two successful DC checks for each upgrade slot.

*Special components take double the time to install.

CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING

\page

### Acquiring a Ship

Most parties will not be able to afford a ship early on, especially at lower levels. Even at later levels, decent ships still might be far out of their price range. Some options for providing easy access to a ship for players outside of giving them tons of money to spend include:

* Saving an island of shipbuilders from a pirate invasion, earning them a free ship or supplies and workers to build one.
* Receiving a ship as a gift from a wealthy contact or quest giver.
* Stealing a ship from a powerful group of pirates.
* Discovering a lost ship graveyard filled with enough salvageable parts and weaponry to build a new ship.
* Finding a legendary artifact in a dungeon that can be traded for a decent ship.

Furthermore, a crew might seek out a signature ship for them to use over the course of the entire adventure. The creation, purchase, or discovery of their ship should be a special moment and major milestone for the crew. Giving them tools to customize, upgrade, and spend time together on their new ship will help forge a deep bond with it over time, making their journey with together all the more engaging. 

## Crew

A ship requires a competent team of crew members to keep it operational when traveling or even harboring. As detailed in the "Crew Roles" in section 4 of the Unofficial One Piece D&D Player's Guide, ship crews may require a diverse mix roles on board a ship to safely adventure into dangerous waters. Disease, malnutrition, poor direction, injury, infection, and ship damage or degradation are all potential threats to any crew attempting to sail into open waters. And on the Grand Line, these risks are even further amplified. Characters that take on special roles required to deal with these threats are referred to as "Officers". Additional NPC crew members and lackeys may be added to the ship later on, called "Hirelings".

### Officers

Here are example officer roles to determine which player will fill which role on a ship:

**Captain.** The captain is in charge of issuing orders and raising morale. The captain should be one of the strongest members of their crew and simultaneously most charismatic or strategic, with the best captains normally having a high Charisma or Intelligence score. 

**First Mate.** Similar to the captain, the first mate should be the second most powerful and charismatic individual in a crew. The first mate will also cover any weaknesses their captain may have. If the captain is killed or retired, the first mate will be first in line to take over or inherit the crew. The first mate may also have a more dedicated role on the crew, such as being a doctor or chef on the side.

**Navigator.** The navigator provides direction and knowledge of maps and weather to the crew. A talented navigator will often have a high Wisdom score, proficiency in Nature or Survival, and proficiency with navigator's tools.

**Doctor.** The ship's doctor tends to injuries, monitors illness, and provides basic medical and scientific expertise. A skilled doctor should have a high Wisdom score and proficiency in Medicine to perform medical procedures or be capable of using healing abilities.

**Chef.** The chef is responsible for nourishing and preparing meals for the crew. Food and drink is the lifeblood of every crew, and the importance of quality and taste in each meal should never be underestimated, as it provides a great deal strength and motivation to every other member of the crew. The best chefs will have proficiency with cook's utensils and brewer's supplies.

**Other Roles.** The primary roles listed above cover roles often considered absolutely necessary to keep a ship and crew up and running. However, other important roles may include a shipwright to physically maintain the ship and repair damage, a musician to uplift a crew's spirits, a skilled lookout for spotting danger from far away, a helmsman to properly maneuver a ship and read the waters, and a record keeper to log the adventure and provide insight into new discoveries and the history of locations or treasure.


### Hirelings
On ships that require smaller crew sizes, 4-5 player characters with different roles should be sufficient early on. On larger ships, however, crew size may need to be increased and additional officer positions may need to be taken to meet the needs of the increased population on board. Large crews may want to designate officer positions for managing each section of the crew. 

When the size of a crew's ship increases, most captains will need to hire additional crew members to keep the ship running. To find more people to fill these spots, hirelings are used. Hirelings can be found in places where seafaring communities are more common, typically in large port cities.

For every 10 hirelings on board a ship, there should be at least one officer managing them to maintain order. This officer can take on a leader position in the chain of command under the captain and first mate, reporting to them at the end of each day. If there aren't enough player characters to fill the number of officer positions required, the captain may enlist a specialist to take on the role of an officer on the crew. Additional crew roles can be filled by hired officers or they can be ordered to assist other officers with their job (A chef that needs help in the kitchen may make one officer their assistant chef).

The downside to recruiting hirelings is that they can be expensive to maintain in higher quantities and aren't usually as loyal as most player characters will be. The average weekly wage for a single hireling crew member is ฿15,000 (฿60,000 each month) and the average weekly wage for a hireling officer or specialist is ฿150,000 (฿600,000 each month). In addition, hirelings need to be fed, sheltered, and treated well. You can use "Recruit" stats under "Monster and NPC Statblock Templates" for an underling, and higher-level stats of choice for an officer or specialist.

```
```



#### Mutiny

If hirelings are underpaid, neglected, or underfed, they will grow to resent the captain and crew over time. Each instance of neglect has an additive 10% chance of leading to a mutiny among hirelings who feel neglected. This chance is reduced when they are given reparation or compensation. When a mutiny occurs, if less than half of the crew partakes in the mutiny, the neglected crew members will simply attempt to commit acts of theft, violence, and subterfuge to sabotage the crew and damage the trust toward the captain without detection, until they manage to escape or resign. If more than half of the crew partakes in the mutiny, a full-scale assassination plot or battle will take place until crew demands are met or the captain is overthrown.

#### Bonds

Alternatively, if a hireling is treated well and bonds with the crew over time, they might eventually graduate to becoming a permanent member of the crew. After some time has passed, these NPC crew members may start to work as apprentices under player characters, learn new skills, or even receive increases to stats. Higher level NPCs and skilled mercenaries may also end up in the crew over time, creating bonds with the crew. See the optional loyalty rule from chapter 4 of the Official D&D Dungeon Master's Guide for more information on determining the bond and loyalty between NPC crew members and player characters.

### Fleet

Once a crew advances into the later stages of the campaign, one ship may not be enough to deal with the impossibly vast number of enemy ships and fleets that are after their heads. Thus, a larger fleet will need to be established.

The primary vessel that the crew and captain travel in should be designated as the flagship, which commands all other ships and vessels within the fleet. Additional ships are controlled by Fleet Commanders, which can be NPC or player characters, and a number of officers and crew members working beneath them on the ship. The captain of the entire crew will be called the head commander of the fleet.

Counting and crunching the total amount of pay for every crew member, officer, and commander as well as total expenses may grow to become tiresome after a while. If this is the case, it might be wise to consider ships other than the flagship to be proficient enough at making money on their own so that expenses aside from major repairs, stolen treasure, etc. can be ignored. Additionally, allied captains may decide to join the fleet under an alliance. In this case, they will rarely require salary pay.

Communication between each ship and commander is vital to keeping a fleet healthy. Luckily, Den Den Mushi phones provide easy communication between ships, also allowing for coordinated attacks against enemy ships or fleets. Similar to mutiny rules listed above, fleet commanders that grow resentful toward the head commander may turn against the fleet and leave or attack the fleet. If this occurs, ship battles within the fleet may occur between player characters, fleet comamnder allies, and the now enemy commanders. Defeating a fleet commander that betrays the fleet has a 50% chance of winning back the ship and crew under the commander. Otherwise, defeating the remainder of the traitor crew will be required to regain access to the ship again.

#### Fleet Orders

Fleet commanders may go off on their own separate journeys, bringing back loot or experiencing tragedy along the way. The head commander can decide if ships in the fleet stick with the flagship or go off on their own under the command of the fleet commander controlling the ship. Communication can be maintained with the flagship and head commander to control what happens with the other sections of the fleet. When a ship in the fleet goes off on its own, roll for it under the "Traveling Events" table to see what happens each time the ship travels to a new area or island. If the ship faces a dangerous encounter, there is a 25% chance that something bad will occur. Roll on the "Ship Tragedy" table to determine what happens if this occurs. Otherwise, the fleet commander and crew win or escape (determined by DM). If the encounter isn't random or minor, the DM may decide what happens or let the players take control over the NPCs for the duration of the encounter.

CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING

\page

## Sailing

Here are travel rules you can use at your table for travel at sea. This builds on the travel rules in the Official D&D Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide.

### Travel Pace

A traveling party will travel aboard a ship at a pace given by the ship's speed stat on its stat block. A ship cannot go faster than the listed speed, but it can go slower if it chooses. Certain environmental effects or buffs may increase or decrease a ship's pace.

If a ship's mode of movement takes damage, it will be slowed for every decreased of 10 in speed, reducing its pace by 1 mile per hour and 24 miles per day.

### Fueling Your Ship

If a ship has a fuel engine installed on it, the ship will require fuel each day to keep the engine running. Each engine on a ship will require its respective type of fuel to function, and can hold up to a maximum of a day's worth of fuel in its fuel tank. Additional fuel barrels will need to be stored on the ship. If the engine goes a full day without a full barrel of fuel, it will shut off and cease to function as an engine until it is filled with a barrel of its fuel type.


Fuel Barrel Cost



Barrel (Based on Engine Type)
Weight Per Barrel
Price Per Barrel




Standard
30 lbs.
฿8,000


Large
100 lbs.
฿20,000


Huge
300 lbs.
฿400,000









### Activity While Traveling

A crew can participate in a number of activities while actively sailing. For more information on "Activity While Traveling" refer to chapter 8 of the Official D&D Player's Handbook.

Additionally, you may refer to the section titled "Crew Roles" in chapter 4 of the Unofficial One Piece D&D Player's Guide for more information on what each character may do during travel depending on their crew role.

The party's pace has no effect on the activities they can engage in while traveling by ship. Here are some other example activities a crew can partake in while traveling:

#### Fishing

A character decides to fish for the day using a fishing net, fishing lines, harpoons, etc., making a Wisdom (Survival) check to see what they bring in. The DC depends on the difficulty of the sea being fished in (DC 10 for Easy; DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Hard). If the check succeeds, the character may roll on the table below.





d10
Catch Result




1
Sea Monster: The character reels in an aggravated Sea Beast, which proceeds to attack. There's a 10% chance the character reels in a Sea King instead.


2-3
Trash: The character reels in a bunch of worthless junk.


4
Weapon or Armor: The character reels in a random mundane weapon or piece of armor.


5
Treasure Chest: The character reels in a chest that has 1d100 x ฿10,000 worth of treasure and gold inside. There's a 20% chance the chest has a treasure map and eternal pose inside.


6
Small Fish: Character reels in a fish equal to 1 day worth of food. The fish has a 10% chance of being poisonous.


7-9
Large Fish: Character reels in a fish equal to 1d4 + their Wisdom modifier days worth of food.


10
Legendary Fish: Character reels in a fish equal to 10 days worth of food.









#### Banquet

The crew unanimously decides to have a large banquet or party. To have a successful banquet, the ones organizing the party must spend at least ฿20,000 in food and drink for each crew member. This will reduce the chances of mutiny occurring down to 0%.

#### Lookout Duty

A character can spend the day analyzing the ship and the surrounding sea. The character rolls a Wisdom (Perception) check to determine if they find anything unusual or detect anything dangerous coming (See "Random Events").

#### Ship Repair

A character who is a shipwright or is proficient with carpenter's tools can roll a strength check (with carpenter's tools proficiency if they have it) to attempt to patch any damage on the ship for the day. On a 15 or higher, one component of choice recovers 1d6 + the character's Strength modifier in hit points. If the component was at 0 hit points and isn't the hull, the component becomes functional again.

#### Making a Map

A character who is a navigator or is proficient with navigator's tools can spend the day making a detailed map of the area they've explored. If the crew returns to the area that has been drawn on the map again, they cannot become lost in it while sailing.

#### Helping the Kitchen

A character who is a chef or proficient with a chef's utensils can spend the day helping flavor and divide food in the kitchen to ensure nothing goes to waste. By doing so, the character increases the number of provisions available on the ship by 1d4.

#### Tending to Wounds
A character who is a doctor or is proficient with the Medicine skill can spend the day treating any injuries. One creature you treat for at least a minute recovers hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.

```
```



### Traveling Events

Each day, there is a chance something new will happen while sailing. Some days, nothing will happen. Other days, the crew will find themselves faced with tornadoes, whirlpools, sea monsters, or other horrible hazards. Or something fun and adventurous might pop out in front of them. In any case, a pirate crew will quickly learn to be prepared for anything that comes their way, especially on the grand line.

#### 100 Possible Example Events

To determine if anything happens during a day at sea, at the start of each day, roll a 1d20. On a roll of 16 or higher, a random event occurs and is determined by rolling on the table below. While on the grand line, a random event occurs on a 11 or higher. On a 20, two random events occur instead (perhaps simultaneously).

While outside the grand line, roll a 1d20 on the table below. While traveling in the grand line, roll a 1d100 on the table below. Events involving disaster or bad weather may utilize later sections (See "Weather" and "Disasters"),

#### Additional Events

Alongside random event examples given here, you may add or replace any number of events with your own ideas. Planned events can also occur before, after or during a random event to make travel more unpredictable. Keeping players on their toes with what to expect will make the adventure far more interesting, and may surprise even the DM.

#### Getting lost

When sailing into uncharted seas, there is a high chance that unprepared crews will get lost, especially on the grand line. Outside the grand line, having a skilled navigator who is proficient with navigator's tools and possesses a compass will allow a ship to automatically succeed at traveling between islands, even in uncharted waters. Without all of these things, one player must attempt navigate the ship to the next island and roll a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check at the start of each day to determine if the crew remains on course to the next island without getting lost. If the check fails, the the crew becomes lost for the day and travel pace becomes 0 for that day.

On the grand line, travel rules work differently. It is virtually impossible to sail on the grand line without a log pose of some kind, and losing a log pose during travel can often mean certain death. Normal compasses will not function on the grand line, and do not provide any form of bonus to travel. A skilled navigator who is proficient with navigator's tools and possesses a functioning log pose will automatically succeed at staying on track during each day of travel. If a log pose is lost or broken during travel, all sense of direction is lost and the navigator must roll a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check at the start of each day to remain on track. If the check fails, the ship heads in a random direction other than the target location at their travel pace.

Every time players get lost, roll on the possible events table to determine what happens while they're lost.

### Weather

Weather is one of the biggest threats to each crew traveling into the grand line. Even outside the grand line, weather can still range from bothersome to lethal. Weather hazards may include thunderstorms, cyclones, blizzards, waterspouts, and more.

#### Generating Weather

Each day, there is a chance that the crew will experience various weather conditions throughout the day. Once per day, roll a number of d20s to determine what type of weather the crew experiences, with a weather event occurring on a roll of 15 or higher. While outside the grand line, roll once each day. While in "Paradise", roll three times each day, and four times if in the "New World". If it is determined one or more weather event will occur, roll on the "Standard Weather Event" table or "Grand Line Weather Event" table to determine the type of each event.

Depending on how the DM decides to run each weather event throughout the day, these weather events can happen right before or after each other, at the same time, or during an encounter.

#### Detecting Weather

A navigator or captain may be able to forecast what type of weather event the crew will face before it arrives to effectively plan around it. They may roll an Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check before the crew experiences the weather event. On a successful check, the crew becomes aware of the impending weather conditions and can reroute to avoid it. On a failed check, the weather event strikes the area unexpectedly. If a weather event has a duration of 4 hours or longer, it cannot be avoided but its duration is halved instead if the check succeeds.

After rolling on a Weather Event table, the difficulty or category of weather is determined. Looking at the tables below, each category lists the types of individual weather events included in each category. The exact weather event can usually be determined by local climate or DM choice. If the players are on the grand line, the type of weather is determined randomly by rolling on the individual event tables to reflect the chaotic nature of the grand line.

* Each hour a ship remains in the cyclone it must make a Strength saving throw or each of its sails take 3d10 bludgeoning damage. 
* Any creature or object exposed to the cyclone takes half fire damage.

##### Waterspout

A waterspout is a tornado that forms over water. It acts as a vortex of violent winds and water, picking up objects and throwing them.

* The waterspout appears in a random location 10d6 x 10 feet away from players. Every 10 minutes roll a 1d20, and on a 1 the waterspout disappears and a new one reappears 10d6 x 10 feet away from players.
* The waterspout has a 150-foot radius and reaches up to the clouds, having an initiative count of 20 and moving 60 feet in a random direction each turn. When it is more than 600 feet away from players, initiative ends.
* When creature or ship enters a waterspout on its turn or when a waterspout enters its space, it must make a Strength saving throw. A large or smaller object automatically fails. On a failed save, the target takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage plus 2d6 cold damage and becomes restrained within the waterspout and must repeat the save at the start of each turn. On a successful save, the target is no longer restrained and is launched 10d6 x 10 feet away from the waterspout in a random direction instead.

Chaos cyclones are brutal weather systems that blast the area with wind, rain, and constant lightning and thunder, using the same rules as both cyclones and thunderstorms except:

* Lightning strikes on a roll of 5 or lower from a d20 every hour instead.
* Characters knocked over are moved 15 feet instead.



CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING

\page

##### Waterspout Storm

Waterspout storms are when several waterspouts form at once in a thunderstorm. These follow the same rules as waterspouts and thunderstorms except:

* 1d4 Waterspouts form instead of one.
* Waterspouts move at 90 feet per turn instead.

##### Firestorm
The sea and sky burn bright red, exposed water begins to boil, and flammable objects begin to ignite unexpectedly.

* A creature that isn't behind total cover at the end of each turn must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 fire damage.
* Flammable objects catch fire and take 1d4 fire damage every 10 minutes unless they are doused in water or put out as an action.

##### Icewave
The sea and sky become dark as even the sun appears to dim, with a wave of subzero frigid air following after.

* A creature that isn't behind total cover at the end of each turn must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 cold damage.
* All water is completely frozen, including 5 feet of the ocean's surface, for the duration. Creatures completely submerged in water are completely frozen, becoming petrified by ice.

##### Meteor Shower
Small meteors mysteriously rain from the sky, striking the ocean at random.

* The rough waves caused by constant meteor strikes force each standing creature to make a Dexterity saving throws, making it fall prone on a failed save.
* Every 10 minutes for the duration of the meteor shower, roll a 1d20. On a 1, the ship or a random creature is hit by a meteor. All creatures and objects within 5 feet of the strike zone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature or object takes 2d6 fire damage from the blast on a failed save, half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Tsunami
A colossal wall of sea water forms in the distance, engulfing and destroying everything in its path.

* The tsunami creates a wall of water that is 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick and forms 3d6 x 10 feet away from the ship or players, lasting for 10 minutes before collapsing.
* The wall moves 50 feet per turn toward players, initiative count 20. 
* Any huge or smaller creature starting its turn inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.
* Each 5-foot section of the wall can be attacked and has AC 5 and 15 hit points, creating a 5-foot opening connecting to the opposite side of the wall.
* Any ship attempting to move through the wall or pass through it must make a Strength check to do so, taking crash damage on a failure (See "Crashing") as the wall moves through it.

### Disasters

Weather aside, a number of other natural disasters may occur. The chances of a disaster affecting the ship is far more dependent on the local environment and circumstances rather than randomness. For example, a ship full of diseased pirates may spread a plague to the crew after a long battle. Or a nearby volcano eruption may carry flaming debris to the ship and cause it to catch fire. Disasters also may occur as a result of a random event, long periods of bad weather, or too many failed crew rolls. However, the most common reason for a disaster is entering a danger zone on the grand line.

#### Danger Zones

The grand line holds many dangerous zones within its waters, which have a chance of bringing about ruin to any ship passing through. Zones of potential risk are usually marked on sea maps and can be avoided. Otherwise, an unaware crew must spend at least a day within a danger zone to understand the nature and risk of the region. While passing through a danger zone, the navigator or captain must roll an Intelligence check with navigator's tools (DC 15) at the end of each day to determine the range and size of the danger zone, so that the crew might follow a path around the region. On a successful check, the navigator or captain may mark the zone on their map, or as much as the DM determines they're aware of. On a failed check, the range and area of the zone cannot be determined, and may make the check again at the end of the next day.

If a crew is caught within the danger zone at the start of a day or enters a danger zone for the first time, the whole crew must each make skill checks or saving throws to determine how seriously the disaster affects them. The type of skill check or save and its DC is determined by each disaster type.

If half or more the crew succeed, the disaster is avoided altogether. If less than half succeed, the disaster strikes, bringing destruction to the ship and crew. 

##### Fire: Dexterity Check DC 12

The hull or a random component on the ship catches fire as a result of nearby volcanic activity, ash, or extreme heat, immediately taking 3d10 fire damage. Have everyone roll initiative, including the ship. At the start of each of the ship's turn, it takes an additional 3d10 fire damage if the fire isn't put out.

For the crew to put out the fire, more than half of the crew must succeed on their Dexterity checks at the beginning of their turn to smother or drown the fire. Additionally the captain or helmsman can instead make a successful DC 15 Intellgience (water vehicles) check at the start of their turn instead to splash sea water onto the ship, giving advantage to the whole crew on their checks. Then, if the majority of the crew has succeeded by the beginning of the ship's turn, the fire is put out.

```
```



##### Explosion: Wisdom (Perception) Check DC 15

A spotter has advantage on this check. An explosion from beneath the ship fires flaming debris all over, originating either from a natural disaster or an explosive such as a naval mine. The hull of the ship takes 8d6 fire damage. Any creature not behind total cover must also roll a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

##### Fog Maze: Wisdom or Intelligence Check DC 15

A crew becomes lost in a thick fog, with various maze-like obstacles and large rocks making it impossible to blindly follow a compass or log pose. The area becomes lightly obscured, and it is not possible to see past 60 feet in the fog with normal vision. 

At the start of each day, the crew can attempt to figure out the maze together, rolling an additional group check. Each time the check fails, the travel pace becomes 0 for the day. If the check succeeds, travel pace is halved. 

If the ship moves at full speed during an encounter, a successful perception (Wisdom) check, DC 15, must be made by the creature steering the ship or it will crash into a gargantuan wall (See "Crashing").

##### Plague: Wisdom or Intelligence Check DC 12

A crew is exposed to a diseased animal, a sick group of people, or some form of bioweapon, causing a plague to break out. 

Each creature in the crew must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes contagious and falls ill from the sickness after 1d4 days. A doctor can spot signs of the disease early by making a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check, DC 15, to order safety procedures and provide medication to give the entire crew advantage on this save. Once a creature falls ill, it will gain a level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points from spending Hit Dice and no Hit Points from finishing a Long Rest. 

At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of Exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s Exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of Exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease. A doctor can treat a number of patients up to their Wisdom modifier each day, granting them advantage on their saving throw.

**Optional.** Different diseases may be more far more extreme or lethal in nature. This may raise the DC of the disease, make creatures develop symptoms sooner, or cause it to have additional symptoms.

##### Sudden Obstacle: Dexterity Check DC 12

A sudden obstacle above or below the water, such as a glacier, giant squid, or sharp rocks threatens the ship and cannot be avoided through steering alone. The captain or helmsman can instead make a DC 15 Intelligence (Water Vehicles) check to also give the crew advantage on their check. If the check fails, the ship crashes and the hull takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage.

##### Infestation: Wisdom or Intelligence Check DC 12

Pests such as insects or rats begin to contaminate food supplies. Once the infestation has begun, the chef can make a DC 15 Constitution (Brewer's Supplies) check to control the infestation. If the check succeeds, only half of the stored rations are lost. If the check fails, all the stored rations are lost aside from what characters keep on their person.

## Naval Combat

These rules provide guidance for using ships in combat.

### Ships and Initiative

A ship uses its Dexterity modifier to roll initiative, adding the captain, first mate, or helmsman's Proficiency bonus to the roll (depending on who is driving the ship).

At the start of the ship's turn, the creature driving the ship decides what the ship does during its turn.

### Officer Actions

Player characters can use their actions to take special officer actions for the ship. Here are example actions officers make use:

#### Aim and Fire

As an action, a officer can better focus the aim one of the ship's weapons. The chosen weapon gains advantage on the next attack roll made until the end of the ship's next turn.

#### Brace

As an action, an officer can prepare the crew to brace the ship for any incoming attack or projectiles. Until the start of the officer's next turn, the ship's hull gains +2 Armor Class against outside projectiles being fired at it. This action can only be taken once per round by one member of the crew, and the bonus does not stack.

#### Full Speed Ahead

As an action, an officer can unfurl the sails and command the crew to work harder. Roll a 1d6 and multiply the result by 5. Apply the total as a bonus to the ship's speed until the end of the ship's next turn. If this bonus is applied to a ship's speed when the ship is already moving faster than normal, use the higher result instead. Don't add the two bonuses together.

## Enhanced Naval Combat Rules
Below are several rules designed to spice up naval combat in your campaign. Should ship-based combat begin to feel monotonous or lackluster, you're encouraged to integrate any of these rules to rekindle excitement.

### Optional Rule: Unified Crew Initiative
Instead of rolling initiative individually for each creature and separately for each ship's crew, consider using a singular initiative roll for the entire crew and their ship. You can use the ship's initiative for this roll, or the Captain or Helmsman's initiative. This permits both the ship and its crew to operate in tandem.

This rule is particularly effective for grand naval clashes, enabling crews to coordinate their actions more efficiently. It's strongly advised to employ this rule in large-scale naval combat, especially if naval warfare feels overly drawn out or cumbersome with a large number of creature combatants. 

### Optional Rule: Creature Cannon Propulsion
For melee characters feeling sidelined in prolonged, ranged naval conflicts, this rule offers another tool for more dynamic combat.

When a ship is equipped with cannons, they can also launch living creatures. If opting to launch a creature rather than a cannonball, the designated cannon forfeits its attack for that turn. To be propelled, a creature uses 15 feet of its movement to enter the cannon. The cannon’s size dictates the maximum creature size it can accommodate: a Carronade holds Small or tinier creatures, a Regular Cannon can contain Medium or smaller creatures, and a Large Cannon holds up to Large creatures. Upon ignition, the creature is thrust in a direction of their choosing, up to the cannon's normal range. Upon landing, an Athletics or Acrobatics check (DC 10) determines the success of the landing. On a failure, the landing creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and gets knocked prone, while a success ensures a safe landing, with the creautre landing on its feet.

If a propelled creature collides with a solid vertical obstruction, they must make a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 8 + one per 10 feet traveled). A failed save inflicts 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet travelled, up to a maximum of 20d6, while a successful results in half that amount of damage.

Once a cannon is fired this way, it cannot be used again until the following round.

### Optional Rule: Rope Acrobatics
For heightened drama during close-quarters ship skirmishes, introduce the thrilling prospect of rope swinging. Successfully swinging requires an Athletics or Acrobatics check (DC 10). With a successful roll, a creature can swing a distance equal to twice its Strength or Dexterity score (select one), in any direction. If they're still aloft post-swing and above a ship's deck and below its upper masts, they can clutch another rope as a free action, letting them hang mid-air until their next turn or use their movement to ascend or descend normally. Creatures can still take actions and attack normally while holding onto a rope this way. 

A creature can also make a melee attack mid-swing if another hostile creature is within its range during the swing. On a hit, the attack gains a bonus +1d4 to its damage roll. A creautre can only make a swinging attack this way once per turn.

### Optional Rule: Naval Warcasting
Casting using spells or magical powers has always been an integral force in shaping the tides of battle, and its presence can be felt even stronger when utilized in naval combat. Spellcasters aboard ships have the unique opportunity to bend the raw power of their magic in conjunction with the brute force of maritime warfare. By using a spell on a ship's cannons or components, a spellcaster can choose one of the following effects based on the spell and affected component:

**Spell-Infused Cannons:** Spellcasters, especially those with evocation or enchantment tendencies, can meld their power with artillery. Before a cannon or weapon component is fired, a spellcaster can channel a stored spell into the cannonball as an action, so long as the spell's casting time is 1 action. When this enchanted cannonball impacts its target, the stored spell is released at the point of impact. For example, a cannonball infused with the Hold Person spell might paralyze a hit crewmember upon detonation. A cannonball infused with the Fireball spell can release the spell's effect centered at its point of impact. The spellcaster must expend a spell slot when infusing the cannonball as an action, and the released spell affects an area equivalent to its normal range or a 10-foot radius, whichever is smaller.

**Protective Barriers:** Abjuration magic can offer valuable protection to a vessel and its crew. Tinkerers and other spellcasters can extend spells like Shield or Protective Ward to envelop parts of their ship, so long as they are standing on the ship and are within 5 feet of the component they are trying to protect. This mystical barrier can deflect projectiles or mitigate the impact of spells aimed at the ship. The larger the area covered, the higher the spell slot required. Covering a Medium-sized component (such as a cannon) with a spell requires a 1st-level spell slot or higher, covering a Large component (such as the Helm) requires a 2nd-level spell slot or higher, covering a Huge Component (such as the Sails) requires a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, and covering a Gargantuan component (such as the Hull) requires a 4th-level spell slot or higher. The protection lasts for the duration of the spell.

**Wind Magic:** Channeling air-based magic (such as from a Gust of Wind spell) into the sails can allow the ship to maneuver with unmatched grace. For the duration, the ship can turn on a dime, gains 15 feet of movement during its turn, and gains advantage on checks related to ship maneuverability. Alternatively, using this on an enemy ship offensively will allow you to slow its speed and reduce its maneuvarability. If you do so against its sails, for the duration, the ship can't turn, it loses 15 feet of movement during its turn, and has disadvantage on checks related to ship maneuverability








CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING

## Crashing

If a ship collides the space of another creature or object, it might crash. A ship does not crash if the creature or object is at least two sizes smaller than it.

When a ship crashes, it must immediately make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage to the hull based on the size of the creature of object it crashed into, as shown on the Crash Damage table. It also stops moving if the object or creature is bigger than it or one size smaller. Otherwise the ship continues moving and the creature or object moves to the nearest unoccupied space that is not in the ship's path. At the DM's discretion, an object that is forced to move but is fixed in place is instead destroyed.


Crash Damage



Size
Bludgeoning Damage




Small
1d6


Medium
1d10


Large
4d10


Huge
8d10


Gargantuan
16d10








A creature struck must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the ship's Strength modifier, taking damage based on the ship's size (as shown on the Crash Damage table) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Docking a Ship

When docking a ship at an island, having a crew and lookout to maintain and guard it can ensure its safety while exploring new locations. Alternatively, leaving a ship guarded at a harbor will usually keep it safe from thieves or disasters, but may cost an additional fee. 

### Shipbuilding and Upgrades
A shipwright or local shipbuilders can spend time constructing or upgrading a boat at a dock or harbor, so long as local supplies are available. More information is provided earlier in the section under "Building a Ship" and "Ship Upgrades".

### Repairs
While a ship is left at a dock or harbor, its damaged component or hull can easily be repaired by local shipwrights for a fee. 

Alternatively, the crew's shipwright or any number of characters proficient with carpenter's tools can spend downtime repairing the ship. At the end of each day, each character actively repairing the ship's component regains 1d6 + the character's Strength modifier in hit points. If the chosen component was at 0 hit points and isn't the hull, the component becomes functional again.

### Hiring

While docked, a captain may consider hiring additional crew members for future voyages or to aid in building and repair at the docks or harbor. Prices for hirelings are listed under "Hirelings" in a previous section. The price for hiring lackeys to aid in ship repair or building is ฿2,000 per day.

## Ship Salvaging

When a players ship is destroyed or when a sunken ship is found, a crew may attempt to salvage any broken components to sell or reuse. A character with proficiency in carpenter's tools can attempt to salvage component other than a hull that has an undetermined amount of hit points. To do so, they must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check (Carpenter's Tools) to recover as much as they can from the component in the wreckage. On a successful check, the component has 1d10 hit points remaining. Otherwise, the component is broken.

Selling a component requires repairing or refurbishing it beforehand. Parts sold are only worth 25% of their base value to shipyards. If a component is damaged, an additional percentage is subtracted from its sell value for every hit point the component is missing.

## Mapping
Keeping a DM map of the ocean and islands throughout the world, as well as various zones, key locations, and tracking where other crews are will help keep track of travel and properly measure distance between islands and locations.

### Finding a Map
Completed maps may be found all throughout the adventure that detail specific sections of the world and sea. These maps can be handed out as quest rewards, treasure, or may be available for purchase in some locations. However, finding a detailed world map is practically impossible, as much of the grand line is unexplored and too dangerous for most mapmakers to draw. Other than maps of chunks of the sea and nearby islands, ordinary maps aren't easy to find, especially on the grand line. To figure out which way to venture, most pirates may attempt to create their own maps during their journey and piece together the surrounding regions as they travel.

### Drawing a Map

A skilled captain or navigator may attempt to create a map during their journey. To do so, navigator's tools are required. A well-made map details each island, regions of the sea, continents, and danger zones in each area it maps. Players may draw a map themselves when given details of the world, or alternatively the DM may give handouts of each portion of the world map the players explore to help them understand where they are. An example of a DM map, which a player would attempt to replicate on their own with given details, is provided on the next page.

# Chapter 3: Monster Manual

When designing encounters for player characters, you may wish to present them with a wide variety of creatures or monsters to face in combat. This section will provide such creatures to occupy your table, with example statblocks you can use or alter for your game. Many of the creatures listed here may be mostly derived from the original series, although some are original creatures that have been only partially inspired by existing characters. Additionally, NPCs will use certain mechanics such as devil fruits and haki in a way that is different from the way player characters use them.

These creatures can be used alongside other creatures listed in the standard Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual and other expansion books.

### Beast Variant: Sea Beast

Sea beasts are large aquatic animals that very closely resemble beasts that normally live above water. To create a sea beast stat block, one can modify a currently existing beast statblock by using the same statistics, except the ones below.

***Challenge Rating.*** The beast's CR increases by 5, rounded up.

***Size.*** The beast's size increases to huge if it is currently large or smaller.

***Docile.*** The beast's alignment is generally neutral.

***Hit Points.*** The beast's hit points increase by 100.

***Aquatic.*** The beast gains an aquatic serpentine tail in place of its hind legs. Its walking speed becomes 20 ft., and it gains a swimming speed of 40 feet unless it already has a swimming speed, in which case it increases to 40 feet. It also gains the Amphibious trait and is resistant to cold damage.

***Immense Strength.*** The beast's strength score increases to 20, unless it is already higher. Also, when it makes a melee weapon attack, it gains an extra damage dice.

***Underwater Senses.*** The beast gains darkvision of 120 feet unless it already has darkvision, in which case it increases to 120 feet if it is lower.

***Tidal Breath.*** The beast gains the Tidal Breath action below.


##### Tidal Breath (Recharge 5-6)
The sea beast exhales a 30-foot cone of cold seawater. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + the beast's Constitution modiifer), taking an amount of cold damage equal to 1d10 for each CR of the beast on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

If the capacity is reached, the whale cannot swallow anymore objects or creatures. A creature that spends more than a day in its stomach acid-infused waters falls to 0 hit points and dies as a result of being digested by the whale, unless the creature remains above water.
>
>***Variant: Adult Island Whale.*** If an island whale is fully grown, it is grows to epic proportions. Use the "Island Eater" statblock listed later in this section for the whale, but use the island whale's Echolocation and Keen hearing instead of the island eater's Reflective Scales trait, use the island whale's Hold Breath trait instead of the island eater's Water Breathing trait, and use the island eater's Vast Stomach trait and Swallow ability instead of the island eater's Annihilating Stomach trait and Swallow ability. Also, the island whale cannot use its Swallow ability as a part of its legendary actions or multiattack action.
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The whale makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. 
>
>***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* (4d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled, escape DC 17. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the island eater can't bite another target
>
>***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
>
>***Swallow (Recharge 6).*** If the whale has half of its movement remaining, it moves into a space that is occupied by one or more creatures. Any creature or vehicle in the area must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or it becomes swallowed by the whale. On a success, a target is pushed 10 feet out of the whale's space. If there is no empty space to be pushed into, the target is knocked prone is knocked prone in the whale's space if its a creature. If there is a fixed object with 50 hit points or less in the space, it is destroyed. Otherwise, the whale is pushed out of the space into a nearby empty space it can fit into.

>***Fling.*** One Medium or smaller object held or creature grappled by the squid is thrown up to 30 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

It can otherwise be altered by its owner in any way they see fit, so long as it doesn't damage or harm the snail in any significant way. When purchasing a Den Den Mushi from a store, it is possible to bundle in such accessories along with the original price of the Den Den Mushi.
>
>***Communication Tool.*** The Den Den Mushi serves as a natural communication device that can be used to contact other Den Den Mushi owners or perform a variety of advanced functions that would normally be designated to electronic devices, such as cameras, telephones, cell phones, projectors, etc.
>
>The Standard Den Den Mushi is used as a real world telephone. It has a dial, receiver, and other parts that allow for it to telepathically communicate with other Standard Den Den Mushi phone devices. To contact another Den Den Mushi user using one's own Den Den Mushi, one must touch the Den Den Mushi and spend an action to dial the target creature's Den Den Mushi number into the dialer implanted into the Den Den Mushi's shell. The Den Den Mushi user receiving a call will have to pick up the receiver using an action after hearing it ring in order to connect a telepathic line between both Den Den Mushi devices. With the ability to perfectly emulate the speech and facial expressions of the creature on the other line, it serves as a representation of the individual a user is calling as they look and speak into it, and vice versa with the user as well. A creature must remain within 5 feet of the Den Den Mushi at all times to be able to communicate through it. To end the communication line, one of the call participants must spend a bonus action to "hang up" the Den Den Mushi.
>
>***Variant: Baby Den Den Mushi.*** A younger Den Den Mushi is much smaller than an adult Den Den Mushi, and can be concealed much more easily. It will still function the same as a regular Den Den Mushi, except its telepathy range is only 10 miles.

>The Black Den Den Mushi is capable of eavesdropping into the telepathic communication line between other Den Den Mushi devices undetected. To do so, the Black Den Den Mushi's user must touch the Black Den Den Mushi and spend an action to intercept a call in between two Den Den Mushi users it knows and the Black Den Den Mushi must make a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the target Den Den Mushis' passive Perception. If this check succeeds, the line is successfully intercepted, and the Black Den Den Mushi can relay and save any portion of the call for its user to hear. The Black Den Den Mushi can intercept a call for up to 10 minutes, until the call ends, or until its user ends the interception as a bonus action. Once this feature is used, the Black Den Den Mushi cannot be used for 1 hour.

## Epic Bosses

**WARNING:** This section introduces a range of exceptionally lethal bosses that you can incorporate into your campaign for late-game encounters. CR calculations may no longer apply to determining difficulty in this section, since it is capped out at 30. Be aware that these bosses present an extreme challenge; even level 20 parties may find them difficult to defeat despite having full resources at their disposal. If your group possesses powerful Devil Fruits and Haki, their characters are built with heavy optimization and epic gear, and a fair assortment of Epic Boons from the standard 5th Edition DMG guide have been given, they will have a fair chance of triumphing over these extreme encounters if fought. Remember that not every one of these encounters need to be beaten through direct combat alone.

## Raising the Stakes with Bounties: The Ultimate Gold & Glory System

If you're a Dungeon Master aiming to include a method of power-scaling or including greater reward for players overtaking enemy pirate crews, introducing a well-crafted bounty system can be a game-changer. This Bounty System offers a robust framework for calculating the bounties of nefarious pirate captains and their infamously skilled crews.

### Putting a Price on Piracy: Calculating Player Bounties

Sure, it might be easy to scrawl out an arbitrary number on a wanted poster, but what’s the fun in a random bounty? With this carefully calibrated system, you'll be setting the bar for pirate prestige and notoriety! Remember, in this world, 1 gp is equal to ฿10,000, ensuring that reputations will be built and lost in a grand scale. Grab your quill and parchment; it’s time to quantify just how notorious your player-pirates truly are.

##### Individual Player Bounty Table
| Category | Add This to Their Bounty |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Player's Level  | Player Level² (squared) x ฿1,000,000 |
| Number of Crewmates | Crew Mates x ฿1,000,000 |
| Devil Fruit Powers | Devil Fruit Rarity Level over Common x ฿10,000,000 |
| Haki Powers | Highest Haki Advancement Rarity Level over Common x ฿10,000,000  |
| Minor Acts of Infamy | Each Notable Deed x ฿10,000,000 |
| Major Acts of Infamy | Each Notable Deed x ฿100,000,000 |
| Ship Power | Ship's Constitution Score x ฿1,000,000 |
| Fleet Size | Number of Additional Ships Under Fleet x ฿10,000,000 |
| Treasure Plundered | Total Belly(฿) Value of Treasure and Goods Stolen x 2 |
| Civilians Captured or Killed | Number of Civilians x ฿100,000 |
| Cities Razed | Number of Cities Destroyed or Raided x ฿10,000,000 |
| Navy Ships Attacked or Destroyed | Number of Navy Ships x ฿10,000,000 |
| World Nobles Attacked or Killed | Number of World Nobles x ฿100,000,000 |


**Note:** You can use the total for the maximum sum of your crews' bounty values, or put most of this value on the captan's bounty. Feel free to tweak these numbers to suit the economic balance of your game. These are just guidelines, after all!

### Putting Bounties to the Test: Example Calculations
To give you a taste of how this Bounty System plays out in practice, let's put some bounties on the heads of two pirates, each notorious in their own way.

#### Example 1: Captain Scarlet

- **Level:** 8 (฿64,000,000 calculated as 8² x ฿1,000,000)
- **Number of Crewmates:** 12 (฿12,000,000)
- **Devil Fruit Powers:** None (No bonus)
- **Haki Powers:** Highest Haki Advancement is Rare (฿20,000,000 calculated as 2 x ฿10,000,000)
- **Minor Acts of Infamy:** 3 notable deeds (฿30,000,000)
- **Ship Power:** Constitution Score of 16 (฿16,000,000)
- **Treasure Plundered:** ฿10,000,000 worth stolen (฿20,000,000 added to bounty)

***Total Bounty:*** ฿64,000,000 (level) + ฿12,000,000 (crew) + ฿20,000,000 (haki) + ฿30,000,000 (infamy) + ฿16,000,000 (ship) + $20,000,000 (treasure) = **฿162,000,000**

#### Example 2: Fleet Captain Vortex

- **Level:** 12 (฿144,000,000 calculated as 12² x ฿1,000,000)
- **Number of Crewmates:** 60 (฿60,000,000)
- **Devil Fruit Powers:** Rare Rarity (฿20,000,000 calculated as 2 x ฿10,000,000)
- **Haki Powers:** Highest Haki Advancement is Very Rare (฿30,000,000 calculated as 3 x ฿10,000,000)
- **Major Acts of Infamy:** 1 notable deed (฿100,000,000)
- **Ship Power:** Constitution Score of 18 (฿18,000,000)
- **Fleet Size:** 3 ships (฿30,000,000)
- **Treasure Plundered:** ฿50,000,000 worth stolen (฿100,000,000 added to bounty)
- **Navy Ships Destroyed:** 2 (฿20,000,000)

***Total Bounty:*** ฿144,000,000 (level) + ฿60,000,000 (crew) + ฿20,000,000 (devil fruit) + ฿30,000,000 (haki) + ฿100,000,000 (infamy) + ฿18,000,000 (ship) + ฿30,000,000 (fleet) + $100,000,000 (treasure) + ฿20,000,000 (ships destroyed) = **฿378,000,000**

```
```

### Bounty Hunting for Players: Calculating Enemy Pirate Crew Bounties

Just as we scaled player bounties by character level and deeds, enemy pirate bounties should reflect their danger and the treasures they guard. With a foundation in Challenge Rating (CR), this framework ensures your players always have an enticing challenge that promises suitable rewards. Only use this table if the captain's CR is 1 or higher, and has the highest CR out of the entire crew.

##### Enemy Pirate Crew Total Bounty Table
| Category | Add This to Their Bounty |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Captain's CR (Challenge Rating) | CR² (squared) x ฿1,000,000 |
| Number of Crewmates | Crew Mates x ฿100,000 |
| Devil Fruit Powers | Increase bounty total by 1.5x |
| Uses Haki? | Increase bounty total by 1.5x |
| Uses Legendary Actions or Legendary Resistance? | Increase bounty total by 1.5x |
| Controls Large Island Territory? | Increase bounty total by 1.5x |
| Ship Power | Ship's Constitution Score x ฿1,000,000 |
| Fleet Size | Number of Additional Ships Under Fleet x ฿10,000,000 |



**Note:** Ideally, you will distribute the total crew bounty amongst enemy crew members, and giving the captain of the enemy crew the highest bounty value. Once again, feel free to tweak these numbers to suit the economic balance of your game. These are just guidelines, after all!

### Putting Bounties to the Test: Enemy Pirate Bounty Examples
Understanding a rule is good, but examples make it clearer. Let's explore how to use your newly minted Enemy Pirate Bounty Table to calculate the bounties of some dangerous sea dogs your adventurers may encounter.

#### Example 1: Redbeard Pirates

- **Captain's CR:** 5 (฿25,000,000 calculated as 5² x ฿1,000,000)
- **Number of Crewmates:** 10 (฿1,000,000)
- **Ship Power:** Constitution Score of 16 (฿16,000,000)

***Total Crew Bounty:*** ฿25,000,000 (level) + ฿1,000,000 (crew) + ฿16,000,000 (ship) = **฿42,000,000**

#### Example 2: Sea Witch Pirates

- **Captain's CR:** 8 (฿64,000,000 calculated as 8² x ฿1,000,000)
- **Number of Crewmates:** 25 (฿2,500,000)
- **Devil Fruit Powers:** Yes (1.5x multiplier)
- **Ship Power:** Constitution Score of 18 (฿18,000,000)
- **Controls Large Island Territory?:** Yes (1.5x multiplier)
- **Fleet Size:** 3 ships (฿30,000,000)

***Initial Crew Bounty:*** ฿64,000,000 (level) + ฿2,500,000 (crew) + ฿18,000,000 (ship) + ฿30,000,000 (fleet) = **฿114,500,000**

***Total Crew Bounty with Devil Fruit Powers and Territory:*** ฿114,500,000 x 1.5 x 1.5 = **~฿257,000,000**

#### Example 3: Eagle-eye Pirates

- **Captain's CR:** 20 (฿400,000,000 calculated as 20² x ฿1,000,000)
- **Number of Crewmates:** 100 (฿10,000,000)
- **Devil Fruit Powers:** Yes (1.5x multiplier)
- **Haki Powers:** Yes (1.5x multiplier)
- **Legendary Actions or Legendary Resistance:** Yes (1.5x multiplier)
- **Ship Power:** Constitution Score of 20 (฿20,000,000)
- **Fleet Size:** 5 ships (฿50,000,000)

***Initial Crew Bounty:*** ฿400,000,000 (level) + ฿10,000,000 (crew) + ฿20,000,000 (ship) + ฿50,000,000 (fleet) = **฿480,000,000**

***Total Crew Bounty with Devil Fruit Powers, Haki, and Legendary Abilities:*** ฿480,000,000 x 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 = **฿1,620,000,000**

These examples demonstrate how to weave the multipliers into the enemy pirate bounties, providing not just a measure of their capabilities, but also hinting at the layers of difficulty your players will encounter. Adjust these figures to better fit the economy and level of challenge in your game, and let the plundering begin!


CHAPTER 3 | MONSTER MANUAL

# Chapter 4: Treasure

Over the course of the adventure, players will accumulate large amounts of Belly (฿) which they can spend for valuable items and favors. However, this may not be enough for many players. Certain treasures, magic items, and special items may appeal more to players as they seek to attain greater power and an advantage in adventuring, roleplay, and combat. These magic items and treasures have been made specifically for a one piece themed adventure, and can be used in conjunction with loot from standard D&D 5th Edition treasure and magic items from the Dungeon Master Guide.

## Random Treasure & Magic Items

Finding treasure is no easy task. Most valuable or worthwhile treasure that hasn't already been looted will likely be far too difficult to reach or find for ordinary pirate crews. Finding these hoards of valuable items, equipment, and fortunes will require crews to risk their own lives in dangerous parts of the seas, such as in the grand line. These treasure stashes might be found in sunken ships, buried on uncharted islands, or kept guarded in dungeons or pirate crew vaults. Players must overcome these challenges to get their hands on valuable treasure.

### Treasure Maps

Instead of handing players treasure right away upon completing a dungeon, beating a powerful pirate crew, or defeating a boss monster, it might be both more fun and thematic to instead reward them with a treasure map. The reason for this is that pirate crews will avoid keeping all of their valuables on them when exploring, so they may instead decide to bury them on a random island and keep them map to it with them. When players defeat such a pirate crew or otherwise retrieve such a map, they will need to locate the treasure using the map to receive their full reward. Locating treasure using the map may require traveling between islands or finding an eternal pose that would take them to the island the treasure was buried on.

### Treasure Tables and How to Use Them

Use the treasure tables from Chapter 7 in the standard D&D 5th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide and convert the gp to Belly to determine the value of treasure in this type of adventure. Additionally, feel free to use magic items from standard 5th Edition, but make any changes necessary to fit the theme of this adventure. Additionally, you may use magic items from this section in the place of magic items listed by the standard Dungeon Master's Guide.

### Special Magic Items A-Z

These magic items are made specifically for a One Piece themed campaign, but can also be used across other standard 5th Edition adventures if desired. Some magic items have been included in the Dungeon and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook instead.

#### Ace (Supreme Meito)
*Weapon (cutlass), legendary (requires attunement)*

This weapon once belonged to the Pirate King, seving as his trademarked weapon. It ranks as one of the 12 Supreme Grade Meito.

You gain a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage Rolls made with this weapon.

**Black Surge.** Ace surges with black lightning haki when held by powerful users. It deals an extra 2d6 force damage to any target it hits.

**Conqueror's Divine Will.** With the Pirate King's immense spirit flowing through it, you gain the following benefits while you hold Ace and are attuned to it:

• You can telepathically communicate with Sea Kings within 60 feet of you.

• Ace scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

• You can cast Dominate Monster (save DC 17) on another creature. Once you have done so, Ace can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Attack Cuisine 
*Meal, rarity based on potion type*

An attack cuisine can be used in the place of any type of healing potion or other magical potion that isn't harmful. Eating an attack cuisine that corresponds to a specific magical potion grants you the benefits of that potion and serves as a meal. After this meal is consumed, you do not need to eat for the rest of the day. 


#### Excite Bullets
*Weapon (any ammunition), rare (mummy), very rare (ice oni)*

These bullets are laced with a special poison which causes its victim to become afflicted with one of the following two diseases depending on the rarity type of the excite bullet.

**Mummy.** A creature subjected to this type of poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take (1d6) necrotic damage and become diseased. The diseased creature must repeat the saving throw at the start of every turn, taking (1d6) necrotic damage on a failed save. Until this disease ends, the damage the creature can’t be healed by any means and the disease decreases the creature's maximum hit points by the amount of necrotic damage it has taken from this disease. If this disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. Any other creature that touches a diseased creature before it recovers will be become subjected to the mummy poison and must succed on a saving throw against it. This disease lasts until the diseased creature succeeds on a saving throw against it. Once it ends, the diseased creature can heal normally, but does not regain its lost maximum hit points until it completes a long rest.

**Ice Oni.** A creature subjected to this type of poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take (1d6) cold damage and become diseased. The diseased creature must repeat the saving throw at the start of every turn, taking (1d6) cold damage on a failed save. Until this disease ends, the diseased creature is under the effect of the confusion spell. Any other creature that touches a diseased creature before it recovers will be become subjected to the ice oni poison and must succeed on a saving throw against it. This disease lasts until the diseased creature succeeds on a saving throw against it, ending the confusion spell effect on the creature.

```
```


#### Energy Steroids
*Pill, legendary*

When you eat these pills, your Strength score changes to 29 for 24 hours. These pills have no Effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

At the end of the 24 hours after you've consumed these pills, you must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, you also age to the point where you have only 1 year left before you die of old age. In this aged state, you have disadvantage on Attack rolls, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws, and your walking speed is halved. Only the wish spell or the Greater Restoration cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these Effects and restore you to your previous age.

#### Muggy Ball
*Wondrous item, very rare*

You can use an action to grab a muggy ball and throw or fire it up to 150 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the ball detonates as a 5th-level fireball spell (save DC 17).

#### Raid Suit
*Armor (light bulletproof shirt), legendary (requires attunement)*

Raid suits come in the form of canisters that transform into a suit of armor around its user. To equip a raid suit, one must be attuned to the canister, hold it at waist level, and spend an action to release the suit from the canister, which then forms around its user. The raid suit remains on until its user removes it as a bonus action, returning it to its canister form.

You gain a +3 bonus to AC, have a flying speed of 50 feet, and gain advantage on dexterity ability checks and saving throws while you wear this armor. Spells or cantrips cast from the raid suit (not counting innate or regular spellcasting you can cast normally) have a Spell Attack modifier of +8 and a Spell Save DC of 16. You can use the following abilities determined by the type of raid suit you possess:

**Garuda.** This raid suit canister is light grey and marked with a white "J", it gains the following properties:

* As an action, you can summon forth a magical lance which you are proficient with. The lance has a +2 bonus to Attack rolls and deals an extra 2d4 lightning damage. The lance disappears when the raid suit returns to the canister, or if you dismiss it as a bonus action.

* You are immune to poison damage and immune to the poisoned condition. You can also spend an action to touch a creature and end the poisoned condition on it

* As an action, you can use the armor to cast Pulse Wave. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

#### Yoru (Supreme Meito)
*Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The Shield spell provides no defense against the sword, which passes through that spell's barrier of magical force.

When you land a critical hit with this weapon, green flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra 2d6 radiant damage to the target.

**Ranged Slash.** The greatsword has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack which you are proficient with, using your strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls, releasing a slashing projectile with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet, dealing the weapon's damage on a hit. Additionally, you can expend 3 charges to cast Great Heaven Splitter^ (Custom spell). The sword regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

First off, thank you so much for reading to the very end of this document. If you are a Player, I would highly recommend you check out the [Dungeons and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ItlMSW6ztZTm) as well, as it provides basic rules for playing in a one piece themed campaign in 5th edition.

 During the last few years, I spent a great deal of my free time between work and university to write, compile, and edit together this conversion system. I hope that many other fans of D&D and One Piece use it freely in their own tabletop groups and campaigns.

I do not claim any intellectual rights to the original One Piece manga/anime series, the official Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition system owned by Wizards of the coast, or any third-party media mentioned in this document. This document was made for completely non-profit reasons and is not to be sold, rented, or redistributed in any way which would require a fee or subscription. This document is a free download intended to further the One Piece fan base and give readers/viewers a means to transform their homebrew 5th Edition D&D adventures into something more One Piece themed. I will refrain from asking for any donations or tips, but do appreciate positive feedback or constructive criticism.

 Modifying this document or improving upon it for personal use or to send to friends is perfectly fine. I would greatly appreciate any advice or assistance anyone is willing to offer toward updating this project in the form of original artwork, ideas, or even a list of errors found in the document. Anyone wishing to join in working on the project is more than welcome. I will personally attempt to make any corrections needed in a timely manner and update these documents periodically. However, I am normally busy with other projects and university work, so it won't be immediate. Unless needed changes are urgent, I will only make major corrections over time.

 If you need to reach out to me for any reason, message me on my twitter @OneWorldHD and I will get back to you. If anyone tries to claim ownership or charge money for this document, please let me know right away.
