# Chapter 0: Starting Information

## Basic Information About These Rules

DMs, be sure to explore the [Dungeons and Devil Fruits Dungeon Master's Guide](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/sK-UDzk7x8U_) for this project! It offers a wealth of information beneficial for planning your campaign. Also be sure to check out the [Devil Fruit Encyclopedia](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/24DkobVl8IGZ), which includes much more information on Devil Fruit powers and details to include in your game!

This rulebook aims to be a One Piece-themed adaptation of the Wizards of the Coast D&D 5e rule books. Familiarizing yourself with the basics of these rules before engaging with this system is essential. Once you've grasped the basic rules and terminology, you're good to go.  [Read this to get started if you are new to 5e!](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)

Furthermore, you'll need a solid understanding of the One Piece Universe. As a Dungeon Master, it's recommended that you watch or read a substantial portion of the series to effectively run this type of game. While it's less critical for players to be familiar with aspects outside of this rulebook, it is still beneficial. Below is a list of considerations and preparations needed before running a game with these rules.

## Things you'll want to understand before playing
### If You're New to D&D or One Piece
* Have a way to run the campaign. If playing online, use a platform such as [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) or  something similar. If playing in person, make sure to have many of the required dice and character sheets set up prior to running a game.
* Come up with a story and world! You can either set up a sandbox world or make a clear path for your players to take if they are less adventurous. Make sure to discuss this with them prior so that everyone is on the same page about what they find fun.
* As stated above, familiaize yourself with One Piece lore and the D&D rules for playes and Dungeon Masters. Below are some more resources to check out!

### Useful Links
* **Devil Fruits** - These are magical fruits that have the ability to grant the eater super-human powers. There are some downsides to this, however. [Read this to learn about Devil Fruits!](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Devil_Fruit)
* **World of One Piece** - Most of the One Piece world is full of a variety of wacky large and small islands. There are very few large continents in this world. There is also the grand lind, the red line, the calm belt, and different sections of the ocean. [Read this to learn more about the World of One Piece!](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Locations)
* **Fighting Styles** - There are many unique and powerful ways of fighting, even if you are a non-devil fruit user! [Read this to learn more about these fighting styles in detail!](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fighting_Styles)

```
```





### Da Rules! (5e)
If you are running a campaign with these rules, it is important to understand the rules of 5th Edition. I would highly recommend using the [Player's Handbook](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/rpg_playershandbook) and [Dungeon Master's Guide](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/dungeon-masters-guide) in conjunction with the rules in this book. Most of the rules from 5e will apply to this campaign setting in this rulebook, only because they are the easiest to understand for most people. The only things that will be different are the races, classes, some spells, items, and a few other rules. Take what you want from the 5e rules and add them to your own game if a rule isn't covered in this book!

Many of the standard rules will apply from the 5e rulebooks such as: 
* Spells, class mechanics, leveling, ability scores, character sheets, and skills work similarly with some modifications.
* Combat mechanics will function pretty much the same.
* Classes and races have been changed or overhauled to fit the One Piece theme.
* New player feats will be added and some will be slightly changed.
* Mages and magic are treated a bit different in this world and can be explained through science, spiritual skills, and elemental powers people naturally use. 
* Most supernatural phenomenon are explained by devil fruits and haki, which serve as a potential supplement for magic items.

### Important Side Note
Understand that when reading this, it is only used as a guide to help you run or play in a game of your own. It is entirely fanmade homebrew. In other words, the Dungeon Master has the final say about what the rules are. You could use 100% of these rules or only 10% , it is up to how you want to run your world! There may be a few typos or grammatical errors, and I will try to spot and fix them. Otherwise, thank you for reading this!

## The World of One Piece
The map below gives a basic outline and potential roadmap for you to use for your own adventure. This section will also brief players who are new to the geography or nature of the One Piece world. You can either use the islands, factions, kingdoms, and objectives established in the main series. Or you could opt to make an entirely separate alternate universe with new factions, islands, and kingdoms custom tailored for your group's adventure. 

Alternatively, you could use a mix of both types of settings, giving homage to certain locations, groups, and characters with your own spin while creating several new islands, allies, and villains for the group to meet. However you choose to run your campaign, using this world map will give you and your players an idea of a path to take to move forward toward adventure and the One Piece.

```
```



### The Four Blue Seas

There are several different seas in the One Piece world. 

**North Blue.** A sea in which many legendary pirates and factions were birthed. The North Blue contains many great kingdoms, as well as once being ruled by the Vinsmoke family, and mostly ocean with smaller islands and some continents.

**East Blue.** Considered the weakest of all the seas. The East Blue contains mostly ocean with many small islands and some continents.

**South Blue.** A sea that, similar to the North Blue, was the home of many famous pirates. The South Blue contains many great kingdoms and mostly ocean with smaller islands and some continents.

**West Blue.** A sea riddled with crime, being ruled by various mafia organizations that run a strong Underworld. The West blue contains mostly ocean with smaller islands.

### The Grand Line

The Grand Line attracts an unsurmountable number of pirates and adventurers, both powerful and weak, to its seas. Many fail to even reach this sea, struggling to navigate its treacherous waters, extreme weather conditions, and powerful rival pirate crews or Marine forces. This sea also requires special tools to navigate. "Log Pose" compasses, for example, must be used to properly navigate and point ships to the next island since the sea's abnormal magnetic fields do not allow for ordinary compasses to be used. Moreover, Log Poses only allow for a limited and linear path to be taken because it will only point to one location at a time once it adjusts to the magnetic field of a nearby island.

#### Reverse Mountain and Red Line
Reaching the grand line from the four blue seas requires travel by ship up through the Reverse mountain, which will carry any ship up with its powerful current and down into a single steep river into the Grand Line. This is a one-way trip, however, and a ship cannot pass back up through the reverse mountain once they've arrived in the Grand Line due to the powerful currents.

Alternatively, one could reach the grand line by traveling across the calm belt. However, the calm belt is incredibly difficult to traverse due to reasons specified below, and is primarily crossed only by the Marines. One last way one could theoretically reach the Grand Line is by traveling across the Red Line itself, which is a massive land formation that is virtually impossible to cross for an ordinary person by foot, to loop around the calm belt and into central portion.

#### Calm Belt
This calm strip of sea that rests on both outer borders on each side of the Grand Line, contains many islands and creatures within it. However, despite its name, crossing the Calm Belt can prove to be instantly fatal to even the most powerful of pirate crews. Due to the complete absence of ocean currents and winds throughout the Calm Belt, there are very few ships that can effectively move through it. Additionally, a near-infinite number of Sea Kings and other sea monsters make the Calm Belt their home and will immediately destroy any suspecting ship or creature attempting to move over it. 

Only a select few ships manufactured by the Marines or special Kingdoms will dare to cross the Calm Belt using seastone technology or sea monster guides to bypass the dangers it presents.

#### Paradise

The first half of the Grand Line, often referred to as "paradise" when compared to the latter half of the Grand Line. Despite its name, this sea is notably dangerous and will eliminate most newbie pirates that attempt to explore it. Paradise contains many small continents and islands with extreme weather conditions, many of which never change in season, temperature, or climate. Each piece of land may contain villages, cities, kingdoms, or countries.  Weather conditions all across Paradise are often lethal to crews without gifted navigators and sturdy ships. 

The Marines, warlords, armies, and established pirate crews will all defend their territories here or attack anyone unfamiliar on sight. Additionally, Sea Monsters and legendary beasts can be found commonly in the oceans or on islands within paradise that can easily threaten to annihilate any unsuspecting ship or traveler.

#### New World

Both the latter half of the Grand Line and the final frontier, this is the place where the strongest of the strong reside. It is also the deadliest sea, forcing even the most experienced of crews and ships into submission with its ruthless and completely unpredictable weather, hostile climates on many islands, and other supernatural threats that may randomly appear at a moments notice.  Much like Paradise, there are many small continents and islands that are spread out across the sea. 

Legendary pirate crews rule over their own massive territories, earning their captains the title "Emperor" or "Yonko". Each compete for territory and resources, with some even aiming for the title of "Pirate King". Territory of the Emperor crews may encompass a massive range of kingdoms, countries, or large sections of ocean. It is often said to survive here, one must align with a Yonko crew or inevitably war against them. There are typically four of these emperors, though that number may change depending on the circumstances and balance of power in the New World. Even the Navy is often afraid of exploring these seas or challenging the mighty Yonko, as more than one Yonko alliance or fleet forming an alliance against them could threaten the entire World Government.

#### Final Island

*To avoid massive spoilers, this section will intentionally be left vague.*

This legendary place rests at the very end of the Grand Line, within the final stretch of the New World. Within this mysterious location exists a colossal treasure that has had most pirates searching for decades to find. It also contains all the mysteries of the past, which will be useful to those searching for the truth of the world. The nature or exact contents of this location are still left open to interpretation, though any DM running their game can allow their players to reach this place by special means specific to their own adventure and world. The name of this island itself can be changed to fit a different plot or storyline for each world.

However one chooses to run this location, it will most likely be reached at the very end of a campaign and will allow players to access the One Piece in some way. Perhaps it can act as a gateway to the treasure. It could be an underwater city which rises to the sky to carry the players to the treasure. It could even itself be a weapon of some sort that has the capacity to destroy the planet. Because the mystery of the One Piece and Raftel has not been revealed yet (as of 2022), it is fair to insert your own spin on what it could be that players find here.

## List of Changes

This written guide serves as a means to more easily run a One Piece tabletop RPG using Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition as a framework. Much of this guide will include near-identical rules and mechanics to the base D&D books. However, many changes, small or large, had to occur to fit in newer mechanics such as Devil Fruits, Haki, new items, etc. For example, Druids were practically deleted to make room for Zoan-type Devil Fruit users. 

More detailed explanations on changes and additions made in this guide are listed below:

#### Version 1.0.0 Changes

* Many buffs were applied to player races, classes, and advancement features. These buffs were made to compensate for newer mechanics such as devil fruits, special items, and magic items potentially throwing off the balance of combat and resources. Players who managed to access these new resources early on will be much stronger than they would be in base 5e. 

* Challenge Rating rules for monsters and enemies may need to be adjusted to match player buffs. Monsters written in the Dungeons and Devil Fruits Dungeon Master's guide will hopefully provide enough insight and design ideas to further help compensate for these player buffs. I think this is a positive as well DMs will be able to swarm their players with low-strength enemies more easily without risking killing them, which much better suits a One Piece campaign. Very high CR enemies should still serve as an adequate threat to players if they get too cocky.

* Character creation has been left largely the same in Chapter 1, with the option to allow players to start with a Devil Fruit, Haki, or a Character Feat to give them a strength boost early on. Standard 5th Edition character sheets can still be used, although additional pages or handouts detailing Haki or Devil Fruit powers and advancements may be needed.

* Level & Adventure Tiers give a bit more description for how to run longer camapigns in this One Piece-themed world.

* Every race aside from humans has been swapped out for One Piece races, each detailed in Chapter 2. Because some races in One Piece are naturally powerful or mechanically "different" from most balanced races in 5e, certain races have been listed as "optional". This means the DM needs to give players permission in order to use those races. I knew people might be unhappy if I left out these more powerful races, so that is why I included them in spite of their difficult-to-balance nature.

* Certain classes in Chapter 3 have been altered or sort of re-skinned to fit the theme of One Piece better. 

* Barbarians have been completely swapped out for "Bruisers", which better represents the abundance of brawler types in One Piece who either don't use weapons or hold basic club-like weapons (e.g. Luffy, Garp, Kaido, etc.) This was heavily inspired by the Pugilist Class by Benjamin Huffman, which more or less combines monks with barbarians. Hopefully after initial testing, this class will feel fun and balanced to use.

* Martial Artists are Monks with Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCoE) changes applied. Subclasses for this class were inspired by original monk subclasses, but combined together to better match the various forms of martial arts in the One Piece world.

* Warriors are basically just fighters. Much like Martial Artists, minor buffs and additional changes were applied from various official books. Subclasses here include a Haki focus, cursed sword styles, and a number of One Piece-themed fighting styles.

* Marksmen are also just rogues with changes made to proficiencies, flavor, and replacing perception-based class features with Observation Haki features. The subclasses here resemble rogue subclasses, but place an emphasis on proficiency with different varieties of weapons and powers added to fit one One Piece world.

* Tinkerers are a technology-based casters that replace wizards. Because "magic" in One Piece is instead explained as technology, devil fruit powers, haki, spiritual powers, paranormal phenomenon, or simply random wacky occurences, casters as a whole have been changed to meet this theme. Tinkerers are wizards who replace "magic" with fictional science and technology which better suits the One Piece world.

* Skalds are sea-themed bards with largely the same toolset and abilities. Most of the class-based changes made were very minor and really just made for flavor.

* Same as skalds, priests are virtually the exact same as clerics. Because clerics are best at dealing with undead, I originally wanted to repurpose their Channel Divinity to be more universal, perhaps turning "spirits" instead of undead. But I figured I would leave it up to the DM to explain how undead can be incorporated in the world via Devil Fruits and science in the One Piece world to make priests still feel useful as a class.

* In chapter 4, character backgrounds have been changed a bit and new backgrounds have been added. Pirate Prestige and Crew Roles are optional mechanics which give players a wider variety of tools they can use to provide utility to their crew. A table for character dreams was also provided.

* In chapter 5, metal coin currency was replaced with Belly (฿), except on some islands where exceptions are made, and conversion rules were included. 


CHAPTER 0 | STARTING INFORMATION

\page

* Certain weapons and armor have been replaced with One Piece-themed gear. Additional guns and melee weapons have also been included.
* Standard equipment and special equipment tables now include One Piece themed gear that players can find and use throughout the campaign to strengthen their characters and abilities. Players can also create or upgrade certain equipment using crafting rules or class and races features.
* Multiclassing rules and features in chapter 6 are still similar to base 5e, but have been altered to match the changes made to classes. New One Piece-themed character features are also provided.
* In chapter 7, which is practically brand new, there are now rules on using Haki and Devil Fruits. To allow for more DM control over how players acquire these abilities, they are largely treated as rare magic items characters have to work hard to get their hands on. Even then, with items such as devil fruits, there is significant risk in trying to find a strong devil fruit power. Because these mechanics aren't tied to character level for the most part, the DM can decide at what points in the story to hand out advancement features or devil fruits to avoid balance nightmares. Alternatively, using random tables and generation can be used if balance isn't a huge concern.

#### Version 1.1.0 Changes

* Minor formatting and spelling fixes as well some very small balance adjustments to classes.

#### Version 2.0.0 Changes

* Pdf now includes new world map.
* Improved Table of Contents page.
* Plenty of new visuals and reformatting.
* Complete overhaul to "Races" section and the addition of the "Giant Human Variant". New Visuals Added.
* Complete overhaul to "Class" section and the addition of Chemist, Hybrid, and Rogue. New Visuals Added.
* Added more to "Crew Roles" as well as new visuals.
* Several balance changes to every section.
* Hopefully fixed more of the problems with pages getting cut off.

#### Version 2.1.0 Changes

* Fixed many issues with sections of the page cutting off.
* Corrects and typos to many parts of the book.
* Some balance changes and additions.

#### Version 2.2.0 Changes

* Some major balance changes to races, classes, and haki.
* Giant human and Kuja subraces are no longer marked as "Optional". Human giant is now Medium, and has reworked traits
* Cyborg fuel price has been reduced.
* Longneck tribesman has been added as a subrace to Yokai Tribesman.
* Tonattas have been reworked and nerfed.
* Bruiser's Thrill of the Fight no longer applies disadvantage on Dexterity saving throw (buff)
* Marksman now gain Expert Reload at 4th level since they would only be able to attack once with firearms when using multiattack without it. Gunslinger no longer gets a bonus action hide after using Quickdraw. (change)
* Martial Artists have been massively buffed and adjusted to fall in line with the One DND Monk changes (buff)
* King's infusion no longer has "except permanent infusion" included in its description. It now instead requires that the one using king's infusion must be holding the weapon for the effects of king's infusion to be active.
* Several haki abilities have been adjusted.
* Several spelling and grammatical errors have been corrected.
* Martial Artist Six Power's Shave has been limited to being used a number of times equal to proficiency bonus, unless a ki point is expended.
* Sky Islander can now use Air Glide once per Short or Long Rest, instead of just a Long Rest.
* Changed "duel of death" name to "Lock-On" for marksmen.
* Specified only female merfolk grow legs at age 30.

#### Version 3.0.0 Changes

* Added the new Devilforged Class in Chapter 3.
* Added the Heavy Thrower feat to Chapter 6, which allows player characters to throw cannon balls.
* Added Chapter 8: Spell Lists, which includes a spell list for each class in the book as well as some custom spells for a One Piece campaign setting. The Mysterious Power feat has been changed to match this.
* Changed the Awakening abilities of the example Doku Doku no Mi, Gura Gura no Mi, Hie Hie no Mi, and Mera Mera no Mi, to instead use the custom spells provided in Chapter 8.
* Many water-based spells have been removed or replaced by new custom spells to fix potential issues with devil fruits getting hard countered by instant water summoning. Merfolk have also been adjusted to reflect these changes.
* Fixed Bruiser's Focused frenzy redundancy.
* Changed Sky Islander's Air Glide ability name to Protection of the Clouds.
* Additional proficiencies have been given to each fish-man subclass. A new fish-man subclass has been added, named the Smelt-Whiting Fish-man.
* Added specification that Chemists cannot use devil fruit powers while in their monster mutation form. Also made changes to monster mutation, making it so that genetics chemists cannot swim or fly until specified levels.
* Removed Concentration requirement for Marksman Lock-On feature. Many additional buffs to marksman ability, and Sniper's Scoping range increased.
* Added Understanding and Appraising Devil Fruits as well as Training Surges and Tutors to Chapter 7.
* Completely reworked Haki and Devil Fruit advancements in Chapter 7, adding a number of new features and replaced many old features. Notably, Awakenings and many Legendary advancements have been massively improved.
* Added Optional Rule: Long Rest Recharge to Devil Fruit creation.
* Revised firearms in Chapter 5. This affects some class proficiencies and starting equipment involving firearms. Also changed the Faster Loading feat to remove the loading property of firearms.
* Linked the [Devil Fruit Encyclopedia](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/24DkobVl8IGZ).
* Fixed typos, grammar, and other inconsistencies.

# Chapter 1: Making a Character

## Setting Up a Character
This is typically the first step in any tabletop RPG or D&D-styled game. Use your imagination to think up what type of character you want to be in this world. Make sure it remains mostly thematic in regards to the setting, as this isn't a standard D&D campaign.

Think about what race you would like your character to be, their personality, goals, back story, specialties, career, appearance, traits, and relationships. Once you have all of these qualities decided, start following these steps below and writing everything down.

Using a "Character Sheet" provided by Wizards of the Coast for 5th Edition, you can track much of this. You may need to make a few modifications for certain things, like tracking Devil Fruit powers.

### 1. Choosing Your Race
Races in the One Piece world are very unique and each exhibit many different abilities and defining traits. Deciding your race can be pretty important to describing your character's appearance and abilities, as well as occasionally defining their goals. Humans are easily the most common race to find when exploring the planet, although you may sometimes find individuals or communities of non-humans living in different areas, typically away from humans.

If you are unsure of which race to go with, Human can be an easy choice. However, races such as Fishmen, Merfolk, Minks, Sky Tribesman, Kuja, Dwarves, and others are all possible races to choose from. More information on these races are listed in **Chapter 2.**

### 2. Choosing Your Class
Each character should specialize in a field while sailing the seas with their crew. A class will determine your prominent talents and skills, allowing your character to hone and grow their abilities throughout the adventure. For example, a Warrior may focus mainly on fighting while tinkerers can be useful in performing specifics tasks outside of combat that may benefit the group, such as navigating. While having an all-around useful character is important, sometimes it doesn't hurt to have a character that tends to be extremely good at only one thing, so long as they benefit the group and feel fun to play. A well-rounded party can make the journey far more enjoyable in the long-run.

Put some time into deciding what you want your character's role to be in the crew. Maybe discuss it with others in the group to see what would work best for everyone. However, make sure to choose something you will have fun with and appreciate. Once you have a general idea for what your class will be, pick from the classes listed in **Chapter 3.**



```
```




### 3. Determining Your Ability Scores
The six abilities that are prevalent in every D&D campaign and determine your character's skills are: **Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.** When you calculate the number of each ability score, you will need to list them on your character sheet.

The Dungeons and Dragons 5th Editions rules should list how you can determine your Ability Scores. However, I will also explain this process here. Using the **Standard Array** method, you can take the numbers **15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8** and assign each number to a different Ability Score. 

You may also choose to **Roll for your Ability Scores** by rolling a d6 dice four times and recording the sum of the three highest rolls. Repeat this process five more times until you have written down six total sums. Then, allocate each of these six numbers to individual Ability Scores of your choice. As an example, you may end up with the six numbers 17, 11, 13, 9, 12, 14 after rolling. You might decide you want strength to be your highest Ability Score, so you would put 17 for your Strength Score. Then you would fill in your other Ability Scores accordingly.

Lastly, one other way you can decide Ability Scores is through using **Point Buy**. You can easily find a free Point Buy Caculator online. It is of course always up to the DM to decide what method is used to determine Ability Scores for the party. Once you have calculated your ability scores, you will make changes to them according to your racial feats.

CHAPTER 1 | MAKING A CHARACTER

\page

### 3.5. Beginning With a Devil Fruit, Haki, or Character Feat (Optional)

If your DM allows for it, your character might've already learned how to use basic haki, learned a character feat, or eaten a Devil Fruit prior to the start of their journey in this campaign. This would mean you gain a Haki ability or random Devil Fruit power at the very beginning of the adventure and cannot consume another Devil Fruit ever again. Of course, this also means you will never be able to swim again. This may make the start of the adventure far easier than normal, but things should even out in difficulty later on.

If you are able to use this rule and start with a Devil Fruit or Haki, you may roll on the "Uncommon" Devil Fruit Table in **Chapter 7**. Once you have rolled your power, you are stuck with it, good or bad. If you instead start with Haki, you gain an "Uncommon" Haki Advancement feat of your choice in Chapter 7. If you are starting at later levels or right on the grand line, your DM may allow you to roll on the "Rare" Devil Fruit table instead and choose up to a "Rare" Haki Advancement feat. Lastly, if neither Haki or a Devil Fruit fits your taste, you may start with a Character Feat in **Chapter 6**. This can technically be done at any point in character creation, but make sure you meet any prerequisites needed for advancements and feats. Make sure to write down the name and abilities of your Devil Fruit as well as your Haki abilities somewhere on your character sheet or use separate handout provided by your DM.

### 4. Describing Your Character
First, hopefully you've already decided on a name for your character. If not, try to think of something you like the sound of. If you can't think of anything, feel free to look up D&D name generators online. Then, start to really develop their personality and appearance in your head.

After you have a concept in mind, you want to start writing and organizing these ideas onto your character sheet. Try to find what **Alignment** best fits them and their morals. Then, start to think up some defining **Personality Traits**. Once your mark those down on your character sheet, start getting into their **Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws**. These will provide a guideline on how you plan on roleplaying and making decisions with your character.

Now you want to decide on your characters **Background**. Your background will provide you with tools and knowledge gained from how you've lived your life prior to the start of the campaign. This will affect how those who recognize you interact with you, how you're treated by the general public, and what your occupation is or was. A DM may provide you with custom backgrounds for this adventure, but feel free to choose from the ones listed in **Chapter 4.**

#### Race, Devil Fruit, and Ability Scores

It is important to take into consideration how your race and Ability Scores can impact your character's appearance and personality. Some One Piece races may be noticeably taller than others, some may be tinier on average, and some may have very distinguishable traits. 

Additionally, if you are a Devil Fruit user, you may have certain physical features or personality traits that match the nature or properties of your power. For example, a user of the Moku Moku no mi (Smoke Logia) might be a huge chain smoker who tends to dress in white or gray colored clothing. A user of the Neko Neko no mi, Model: Lion (Zoan) could dress up in flashy golden clothing and consider themselves royalty. If your character ate a Devil Fruit before being introduced to the party, consider incorporating how you got the power and how it impacts your daily life into your background. It is up to you how you want to incorporate the theme of your Devil Fruit into your character.

Furthermore, your final ability scores may also factor into your appearance and attitude. Here are some examples:

A character with high strength may appear physically intimidating and bulky, with defined muscles and a towering figure. With low strength, they might appear scrawny or flabby.

A character with high dexterity may appear incredibly quick and versatile when moving around, with a potentially more lean appearance. With low dexterity, they may be heavier or move a bit slower than others.

A character with high constitution may appear noticeably healthy and sturdy. With low constitution, they may look a tad bit sickly or pale.

A character with high intelligence may appear more structured or knowledgeable when talking to others, perhaps having several books or scrolls in their possession. With low intelligence, they may speak noticeably slow, sometimes having a dumbfounded look on their face when hearing complicated explanations.

A character with high wisdom may appear more aware of their surroundings and have a grasp on the deeper meaning of interactions in their daily lives. With low wisdom, a character may seem aloof or carefree to others.

A character with high charisma will most likely stand out in public and most social situations, having the ability to influence the attitudes and thoughts of others through interacting with them. With low charisma, a character may be more easily ignored or feel slightly more difficult to agree with in conversations.

### 5. Getting Equipped

Class and background will typically decide what equipment your character starts with. Your equipment includes weapons, armor, tools, trinkets, clothing, and other gear. Look at Chapter 5 to record this information on your character sheet. 

Alternatively, you may choose to purchase your starting equipment instead. You will start with a set number of **Belly** (฿) to spend on equipment, based on the value given to you by your class.

Further information on starting gold based on class is detailed in **Chapter 5**. Weapons in the One Piece world include various types of firearms such as pistols, rifles, and occasionally very high-tech weaponry such as laser beams. The most common weapons you will find are guns like flintlocks, and swords such as cutlasses and sabers. Much higher firepower weapons such as cannons are common, but are typically only used on ships or in fortresses.


CHAPTER 1 | MAKING A CHARACTER

\page

**Melee Weapons** require that you roll a 1d20 and add your strength or dexterity modifier as well as your **Proficiency Bonus** to the roll to hit. This modifier is also usually added on top of the damage roll. Melee weapons tend to use strength modifiers, but occasionally allow you to use other modifiers depending on your weapon or class.

**Ranged Weapons** require that you roll a 1d20 and add your strength or dexterity modifier as well as your **Proficiency Bonus** to the roll to hit. This modifier is also usually added on top of the damage roll. Ranged weapons tend to use dexterity modifiers, but occasionally allow you to use other modifiers depending on your weapon or class.


Traditional armor is used far less in the One Piece world often due to how inconvenient it can be for mobility, but it can still be rarely utilized by very tanky pirates. For this reason, it might be wise to reflavor these items for certain characters by instead using durable clothing or body armor that can be used underneath clothing as a substitute. Shields are not used quite as often either, but can still be found and used by very defensive-style duelists. 

**Armor Class** without armor is normally equal to 10 + Dexterity Modifier. Certain classes might change how this is calculated. Additionally, wearing armor or using shields will alter the Base or Modifier value of your AC.

*Be sure to write down all of these values on your character sheet for easy access and to remember them for combat encounters.*

### 6. Wrapping Up Session 0
If you are playing with a large group, it is sometimes a good idea to get everyone together a week or so before the first official campaign session to discuss character setup. This is usually called Session 0. With the help of your Dungeon Master and fellow players, try to decide how you want your characters to mesh together. Does everyone in the party/crew know each other before the campaign starts? Does your backstory include any of the other player characters or NPCs? How will your character's background and current occupation fit into the crew's goals and the story? These are all important questions to ask yourselves and especially the DM. 

## 1st level and beyond
By exploring the One Piece World and fighting your way through various forces, your characters will start to develop new strategies and grow stronger over time. Each time a major advancement occurs, either due to reaching a specific number of **Experience Points** or reaching a **Milestone** in the story, you will gain a Character Level. 

For example, if you start at level 1 with 0 Experience Points and gain enough experience over the course of a session to make your way to Level 2, you will mark this on your character sheet and upgrade your stats accordingly during your next Long Rest. Additionally, your DM may decide to use a Milestone system by granting you a level up upon reaching a new area or island, completing an important objective, or obtaining a key item or treasure.

### level tiers during the adventure
During the journey, the DM may decide to structure the pacing and level advancement throughout the adventure to give the feeling of progression to players. By deciding level tiers for certain areas in the world, it will be easy to balance enemies and NPCs in ways that align with player progression.

The **first tier** (levels 1-4) will be for very early exploration throughout the seas outside of the Grand Line, including the North Blue, East Blue, South Blue, and West Blue. It would be wise to start in one of these seas, preferably a fair distance away from *Reverse Mountain* and the Grand Line. Player characters will be fairly weak at this tier, and will only encounter minor enemies and challenges until they reach the Grand Line.

The **second tier** (levels 5-10) will be where most of the first half of the campaign takes place, in a portion of the Grand Line called "Paradise". This will be where many mid-tier pirates and powerful members of the navy reside. The sea and various islands will be difficult to traverse, with sea monsters and extreme weather conditions constantly bombarding your travel at random. Surviving to the end of Paradise should prove to be a challenge and feel like an amazing accomplishment upon completing the end. However, the next two stages should feel far more threatening.

The **third tier** (levels 11-15) is where players will start facing extremely overwhelming challenges. Making your way into the second half of the Grand Line, called the New World, the party should be facing unimaginably powerful pirate crews called the Yonko (or Four Emperors). The weather and islands here are even more threatening than the first half of the grand line, enough for a majority of crews to perish upon initially reaching this area. This will be the stage where characters start training, conducting espionage on the Yonko, and collecting Road Poneglyphs.

The **final tier** (levels 16-20) is the last stretch of the journey. At this legendary tier, characters should be able to stand up to Yonko pirate crews and marine admirals. Most fights will be overwhelmingly large-scale and epic, involving hundreds or thousands of pirates in huge wars and battles across the end of the New World. Once several Yonko have fallen and Road Poneglyphs are copied down, the crew can make their way to the One Piece to become pirate kings/queens and complete the adventure.

# Chapter 2: Races
The races in One Piece all have a variety of distinct traits that set them apart from one-another. While humans are the most common and reside on most islands, other demihuman races have their own islands and territories that they reside in around the world. These demihuman races also have a wide variety sizes, characteristics, abilities, and cultures. In many cases, non-human races can be seen as much stronger by default than ordinary humans. However, many humans may opt to regularly train to be on par with these races as well.

Typically, non-human races don't mingle well with human civilzation and culture due to the severe level of racism and oppression often being brought non-humans by the Navy and World Government, which further fuels anti-human sentiments among the human populace. When a non-human is introduced into a human society, it will most likely be treated more harshly than their human counterpart, oftentimes alienating them completely. Likewise, Humans may also be treated differently when entering a non-human tribe or country due to the resentment they hold. It is up to the DM to decide how to run these encounters during roleplay. 

Remember, the One Piece world is very divided and has many themes of slavery and extreme hatred toward non-humans. If these themes are too extreme or uncomfortable to run, feel free to remove most of the racial tension for a more relaxed experience for non-human player characters.

```
```

## Player Races

When choosing a player character's race, it is important to choose an option that suits the character's personality, background, appearance, and perhaps even class and abilities. For example, a characer that loves to swim and interact with aquatic creatures may be best suited by picking the Fishman or Merfolk race. In order to properly make this choice, read each race option and consult with your DM for any questions or advice you may need.

For the purposes of game balance, many races from the One Piece world will be restricted from players. While some may technically be listed below for more lenient DMs to allow, they are by no means on the same level as the rest of the included races in this section. Races that may break game balance or prove to be far too strong will be marked with the "Optional" tag.

> ##### Universal Language
> You may notice the complete absence of spoken or written language traits available as you read through the below races.
>
> Due to the One Piece world having few, if any, diverse languages spoken, even among other non-human races, it can be assumed that each humanoid creature shares a "Common" language in which they can all speak with individual literacy depending on the creature's intelligence.


  







CHAPTER 1 | MAKING A CHARACTER

\page

## Human

In the world of One Piece, humans can be considered highly invasive and territorial to most other races and creatures. While there are many good-spirited humans out there, the World Government and Navy often tarnish the reputation of humans among non-humans. Due to this fact, most non-human races don't get along well with humans on average. However, there can very well be brotherhood among these races in certain circumstances, so long as compassion and friendship is shown. 



**Conquerors.** Humans will settle in and take control of just about anywhere they can reach. The exception to this rule may be places like Fish-man Island or Zou, which are too inconvenient and out-of-reach to settle on for most human civilizations. Most of the world is conquered and ruled by humans under the World Government. 

**Great Kingdoms.** As humans have expanded over the centuries, they have established many large cities, kingdoms, and fortresses across various islands and continents. Human culture can also be very different depending on where you look. While some human settlements can be more open-minded and accepting, other places may be far less tolerant toward outsiders and different ideas or cultures.





### Human Traits

While many humans vary in shape and size, your human character will have these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your ability scores each increase by 1.

**Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their teens and live for around a century.

**Alignment.** There is no clear alignment that is consistent among all humans. Just about any alignment can be justified.

**Size.** Humans in the One Piece World are typically 5-6 feet tall. Some can rest far outside this range, but your size will count as medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.



#### Human Variant Traits

Some humans can be noticeably different in their abilities and skills. For this reason, you may choose to instead replace the standard Human Ability Score Increase with these traits instead:




**Ability Score Increase.** Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1.


```
```

**Skills.** You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

**Feat.** You gain one Character Feat of your choice that you meet the prerequisite for in **Chapter 6**. You may only choose a Haki-related feat if you receive DM permission.

#### Human Giant Traits

Very rarely, some humans may grow to be astonishingly larger than most others in the One Piece world, sometimes even doubling the average human height and weight. If your human character happens to fall under this category, you may choose to replace the standard Human Ability Score Increase with these traits instead:

**Ability Score Increase.** You increase your Strength score by 2.

**Size.** Human giants are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**Natural Athlete.** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.

**Warrior Training.** You have proficiency with the Battleaxe, Handaxe, Light Hammer, Longsword, Club, and Spear.

**Giant's Endurance.** You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

**Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.









#### Kuja Traits

If your human character is female, you may choose to take this Kuja variant subrace. If you do so, you may choose to replace the standard Human Ability Score Increase with these traits instead:

**Ability Score Increase.** You increase your constitution, wisdom, or charisma score by 2.

**Skills.** You gain proficiency with longbows, shortbows, shortswords, and spears.

**Beginner Haki.** You can choose to take the Color of Armament Training feat if you meet the prerequisite.

## Fishman

Fishmen, along with Merfolk, are one of the two races of humanoids that inhabit the sea. Fishmen are a roughly equal mix of Human and Fish, with human-like appendages and faces crossed with sea creatures such as sharks, blowfish, and other fish. They also have gills between their shoulders and necks, as well as often having webbed hands. Some species of fish-men may have extra appendages depending what on what species of fish they represent.

Fishmen have both lungs and gills, which allow them to breathe underwater and on land. Their webbed fingers and agile bodies allow them to move quickly in water for as long as they want. Some fishmen use their naturally strong bodies and unique features as a reason to believe they are superior to Humans. Despite these beliefs, fish-men often end up being the ones to become enslaved and oppressed by Humans, which drives their hatred for them even further. However, not all fish-men think this way and can actually get along well with humans as equals.

**Hybrids.** Fishmen have the ability to interbreed with other races, much like other humanoid races. It is not impossible to find half-humna or half-giant fishmen in places such as the grand line. Furthermore, fishmen can have children with merfolk, resulting in either a fishman or merfolk child being born.

**Oppressed.** Like other non-human races, fish-men are the victims of world-wide oppression by humans. Due to this, many fish-men stay within the confines of fish-man island and only occasionally leave. Some evil fish-men have opted to be pirates to seek revenge against humanity. Unfortunately, several also end up as slaves under the world government. Even on islands not directly under world government jurisdiction, humans still treat fish-men very unfairly. For this reason, playing a fish-man can prove very different when visiting various human-inhabited islands around the sea.

**Domination.** Though they are often misunderstood, many fish-men do hold the belief that they should rule over all other fish in the sea. And due to the cruel treatment they receive from humans, some grow to also want to conquer and rule over humanity as a whole. This isn't true of all fish-men though, as many do exhibit the desire to co-exist with other races and species.

**Extraordinary Strength.** As well as being born with bodies that provide natural weapons in battles, such as razor-sharp teeth, fish-men have incredibly strong bodies compared to average people. From birth, fish-men are ten times stronger than humans. Additionally, fish-men can be even more troublesome in underwater combat. Being even stronger underwater, they can easily devastate a human who isn't proficient at swimming. Unfortunately, this strength can be negated if a fish-man happens to be a Devil Fruit user.


CHAPTER 2 | RACES

### Fish-Man Traits

Your fish-man character will have these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your consitution score increases by 1.

**Age.** Fish-men reach adulthood in their teens and live for around a century.

**Alignment.** Most fish-men are lawful and many stay true to their values, though some lean toward being neutral. Fish-men can live in harmony with other sea creatures, but may turn violent against humans. For this reason, a fish-man can range from being good to evil.

**Size.** Fish-men are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds on average. Your size is medium.



**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a Swimming speed of 35 feet.

**Amphibious.** You can breathe air and water.

**Underwater Athlete.** You have proficiency in the Athletics skill. While underwater, you face no penalties or disadvantage as a result of underwater combat rules.

**Adapted to the Sea.** With the ability to adapt to extreme underwater depths, you have Resistance to cold damage.



### Fish-Man Subraces

**Subrace.** Breeding among fish-people resulted in three main subraces: Shark, Manta Ray, Octopus, or Smelt-Whiting variants. Choose one of these Subraces and add its traits to your racial features alongside the ones listed above.

#### Shark Traits

These fish-men are known to have sharp shark-like teeth, light blue-tinted skin, large back fins, and extreme strength.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2.

**Apex Predtaor** You have proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

**Bite.** Your razor-sharp teeth are a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an Unarmed Strike.


#### Manta Ray Traits

These fish-men are known to have wide side-fins and light-blue skin, moving at high speeds underwater.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**Underwater Acrobatics** You gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. You have advantage on acrobatics check made while underwater.

**Sea Glide.** You have a Swimming speed of 40 feet.


#### Octopus Traits

Octopus fish-men tend to have six arms and red or brown-tinted skin, with a lot of flexibility with their multiple appendages.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength and Dexterity scores both increase by 1.

**Deadly Precision** You gain proficiency in one of the following: sleight of hand or an Artisan's tool of your choice.

**Multi-Armed.** You have four additional arms, six in total. While you cannot efficiently wield weapons with these arms, you may use them to hold smaller items such as potions and trinkets. Additionally, you have advantage on grapple checks with your arms.

#### Smelt-Whiting Traits

Smelt-whiting fish-men are known to have more dominant fish-like characteristics compared to other fish-men, and can spit water at their enemies.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2.

**Big-Mouthed.** You gain proficiency in the Deception or Persuasion skill (your choice).

**Hydro Cannon** You have the natural ability to shoot concentrated blasts of water out of your mouth. You can cast ray of frost with this trait. Starting at 3rd Level, you can cast Ice Knife with it. Once you Cast a Spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a Long Rest. Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for these Spells.



CHAPTER 2 | RACES

\page

## Merfolk

Merfolk, along with fish-men, are one of the two races of humanoids that inhabit the sea. Merfolk have the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish. Both races are ruled by the undersea king, King Neptune.

Merfolk have access to various skills while underwater, such as extremely fast swimming speeds, weapon proficiency, and the ability to communicate with many sea creatures. Very rarely, a mermaid can be born with the ability to speak with Sea Kings. Only a mermaid princess possesses this power, however.

**Peaceful.** Unlike fish-men, merfolk are far more peaceful and prefer to live in secret away from most other races. Despite their differences, merfolk and fish-men get along very well. 

**Sea to Land.** Due to their lack of legs, they move very slowly on land. This makes sea travel their primary method of getting around, and they're very proficient at it. However, upon reaching the age of 30, their tails will split and allow them to walk on land much easier.

**Victims of Slavery.** Despite their efforts to stay away from the surface, some merfolk still end up captured and sold into slavery. Because of their rarity, many can sell for incredibly high prices if they are under 30.

**Beauty and Grace.** Merfolk are all considered incredibly beautiful by the standards of humans. This beauty is mostly lost when they reach the age of 30 when their tail splits. They are also far less brutish than fish-men, making them a bit less likely to be involved in physical altercations. Merfolk are more commonly involved in activities or occupations that involve their speed or intelligence. Though, many are stilled trained in the military and can use a fighting style known as Merman Combat.


```
```

### Merfolk Traits

Your merfolk character will have these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity, Wisdom, and Charisma scores each increase by 1.

**Age.** Merfolk reach adulthood in their teens, mature considerably in their 30s, and live for around a century.

**Alignment.** Most merfolk are neutral or lawful good. However, few may turn violent against humans and become evil. They are rarely chaotic in nature.

**Size.** Merfolk are between 6 and 7 feet long and weigh between 160 and 240 pounds on average. Your size is medium.



  







**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 10 feet, and you have a Swimming speed of 50 feet. Once you reach age 30 as a female, your walking speed becomes 30 feet.

**Amphibious.** You can breathe air and water.

**Merfolk Training⁠**. You have proficiency with the spear, Trident, and net.

**Merfolk Combat.** Being trained in underwater combat, you can control the flow of water to attack your enemies (ice and cold damage is treated as water). You can cast Ray of Frost with this trait. Starting at 3rd Level, you can cast Ice Knife with it, and starting at 5th Level, you can also cast Rime's Binding Ice with it. Once you Cast a Spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a Long Rest. Charisma is your Spellcasting Ability for these Spells.

**Adapted to the Sea.** With the ability to adapt to extreme underwater depths, you have Resistance to cold damage.

**Languages.** Merfolk can all speak and understand the universal spoken language of this world. Additionally, using gestures and sounds, you can communicate simple ideas with any beast that has an innate Swimming speed.

## Sky Islander

Those who live up in the Sky Islands have adapted and adjusted to live in such an environment. There are three main factions that exist up here: Shandians, Birkans, and Skypieans. All three of these groups descended from a moon, sometimes referred to as "Fairy Vearth". On this moon, a great civilization existed named Shandoria. These three groups were a part of this civilization and were believed to have worked in unison.

Centuries after leaving the moon, these races have split apart and can be considered mostly divided into different tribes. These tribes now live mostly on Sky Islands and form civilizations in the clouds with their own cultures and technology. Some use a seemingly magical power called Mantra, which is actually Observation Haki.

Some sky islanders descent from the skies down to land, known as "Vearth" to them, and can interact with the various other races.

These three tribes can be described in the following ways:

#### Shandians

Once Shandians descended from the moon, they lived on a land-based island named Jaya. However, this island was blasted into the sky by a knockup stream, leaving the Shandians stranded in the sky for many centuries. Like the others that live on these sky islands, Shandians are known to grow wings on their backs. However, unlike the other groups, their clothing is similar to real-world native Americans. Additionally, they can often be seen with large tattoos decorating their bodies. Shandians fight as fierce and skilled warriors, surviving for many long centuries with these skills. 

In ancient times, Shandians fought in a great war against the twenty kingdoms on land. At the end of this war, they were defeated. However, they held on to the ruins of the golden city of Shandora and the Shandorian Golden Belfry Bell, which they now protect with their lives even after it was blasted into the sky long ago. They also protect a Poneglyph left to them by an ancient Great Kingdom they were allies with during the great war.



#### Birkans 

Although not much is known about this civilization, it does share some similarities with other Sky Island groups. Much like the other two groups, Birkans all grow wings on their backs. However, Birkans do have a unique appearance compared to the others. Birkans can sometimes appear to have goat-like features such as long goat-like ears growing alongside their regular human ears, and small horns. 

Additionally, many Birkans dress in long white robes and gowns, often resembling priests. Many birkans consider themselves divine in nature, and dress accordingly. Unfortunately, the island of Birka was destroyed many years ago, though many survivors still remain. Many Birkan survivors are gifted with strong mantra in combat.

```
```



#### Skypieans

Many Skypieans reside on the sky island known as Skypiea. This island is massive and contains various technologies that make use of Dials, which are found naturally around it. Many Skypieans have angel-like appearances and grow wings on their backs, similar to Birkans and Shandians. Additionally, their hair often resembles the antenna of an insect, their skin is far lighter than the other groups, and their clothes are far more basic.

Skypiea is a grand island that has come to slowly resent outsiders due to the damage dealt to them from non-skypieans. They use a currency known as Extol in place of Belly (฿). Skypieans all fully obey their great leader, known as "God".

### Sky Islander Traits

Your sky islander will have these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

**Age.** Sky islanders reach adulthood in their teens and live for around a century.

**Alignment.** Sky islanders vary in alignment, ranging from good to evil, lawful to chaotic, but are typically neutral in some way.

**Size.** Sky islanders in the One Piece World are typically 5-6 feet tall. Some can rest far outside this range, but your size will count as medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Languages.** Sky islanders can all speak and understand the universal spoken language of this world. 





### Sky Islander Subraces

**Subrace.** The separation of groups living on the "Fairy Vearth" resulted in three main subraces splitting off: Shandian, Birkan, or Skypiean variants. Choose one of these Subraces and add its traits to your racial features alongside the ones listed above.

#### Shandians

Your Shandian heritage has gifted you with great strength and combat expertise.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2.

CHAPTER 2 | RACES

## Mink
Much like fish-men and merfolk, minks appear to have a mixture of animal-like and human features. Each mink resembles a certain type of furry mammalian animal. Their features and appendages are very human-like, but often have paws and padded paws. Male minks look much more bestial and hairy, while female minks appear more human-like.

**Strength of the Animal Kingdom.** They are considered fearsome and powerful by many, and rightfully so. Minks are born with immense power, speed, stealth, and instincts. Their abilities are far superior to ordinary humans, even at a young age. Every mink, regardless of if they are young or old, is a powerful warrior in battle. This power is greatly elevated when their Sulong Form is activated under a full moon.

**Victims of Slavery.** Much like many other non-human races, Minks are sometimes victims of slavery and are valued for their exotic appearance and strength. Additionally, many humans may treat minks with similar amounts of hatred to how they treat other non-humans. This can lead to some degree of resentment between both races, though likely not quite as extreme as certain fish-men. Many minks have the ability to get along with humans if there is some level of understanding and respect.

**Residents of Zou.** Most minks reside on a city atop an ancient island-sized elephant named Zunesha. This city is referred to as Zou, which exists somewhere in the New World. This city is incredibly difficult to locate, allowing minks to live away from pirates and the reaches of the World Government. However, some minks do venture outside of Zou, sometimes as pirates, or decide to live in Totto Land.

### Mink Traits

Your mink will have these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom scores each increase by 1.

**Age.** Minks reach adulthood in their teens and live for around a century.

**Alignment.** Most minks are neutral or lawful good. However, few may turn chaotic and give into their primal urges if exposed to the full moon for long enough.

**Size.** Minks in the One Piece World are typically 5-6 feet tall. Some can rest far outside this range, but your size will count as medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.


  


```

## Cyborg

As the name would imply, this race includes any human or life form that has had their body altered using metal or robotic parts. Typically, this might only include surface-level alterations, such as steel skin or a robotic hand. However, cyborgs may vary in how much of their body has been modified. Regardless of the degree of modification, they will always still have several parts of them that remain organic.

### Cyborg Traits
Your cyborg will have these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

* You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

Once you are finished, you gain the AC and bonuses of your chosen armor as if you were wearing it, as well as all of the side-effects of that armor. To remove this armor, you must spend an hour replacing it with artificial skin.
* This metal skin cannot be removed from your body against your will.

**Robotic Resistance.** You have advantage on Saving Throws against being Poisoned, and you have Resistance to poison damage.

**Maintenance.** Instead of sleeping each day, you instead conduct maintenance on your body during a Long Rest. This includes oiling your joints, repairing any dents or broken parts, or fixing anything else you'd need to maintain. This takes at least six hours to complete. You are able to see and hear normally while you complete these tasks.

## Optional Races

These optional races are intended to be used for games where the Dungeon Master approves of the use of races that might interfere with the game balance in a way that might feel unfair to some.

If these races don't fit into the way you want to run your game, feel free to leave them out or repurpose them for use as NPCs.

## Dwarf [Optional]

Dwarves are a race of smaller humanoids, some small enough to fit into the palms of many medium-sized races' hands. Many can be considered gullible and are often convinced or tricked into work for others. 

**Work as Slaves.** Despite how cute and innocent they appear, many are still abused and preyed on by humans and other races. Dwarves can often be sold as slaves, as they are seen on a list of slave prices. For this reason, many of them try to live in secret away from outside societies. 

**Strength and Speed.** Dwarves possess immense strength that allows them to shatter stone with ease. Additionally, they are incredibly slippery and hard to spot, allowing them to evade just about any attempt to catch them. For these reasons, they are often considered to be akin to the stories of fairies.

### Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf will have these traits

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

**Age.** Dwarves reach adulthood in their teens and live for around a century.

## Lunarian [Optional]

Lunarians are a nearly extinct race of humanoids with feathered wings and the ability to control and produce fire to use as a weapon. Very few, if any, exist in the world as most of them suddenly disappeared and were thought to be eradicated.

**Race of Gods.** Lunarians were once revered as a tribe of "gods" living on the planet. Living on the Red Line long before the Celestial Dragons, they had a kingdom built on it referred to as "Kami no Kuni" or "Land of the Gods". However, at some point the tribe was thought to have went extinct. Though there are thought to be a few survivors to this day, the World Government viciously hunts any Lunarians and will place large bounties on any they can't locate themselves.

**Physical Features.** Lunarians are large humanoids with feathered black wings. Their wings have no real limitations, and allow them to fly at blinding speeds. The ones that exist today have dark skin with silver-white hair. They also have a large fire plume emanating from their upper back which ignites and burns out occasionally. Their height and physique is typically massive, although it may vary accross individuals. These incredible features grant them superhuman powers, durability, and the ability to travel and live in just about any location above land.

**Burning Bodies.** Producing red flames from their bodies using their ability to "hakka" or ignite, they can also manipulate these flames in a variety of ways. The flame on the back of a lunarian reflects the speed and durability of its body, with its flame appearing larger when its fighting defensively or appearing smaller when its prioritizing agility. A Lunarian's flame can also be used to coat its limbs or weapons so that it can be used effectively in combat.

Your lunarian will have these traits

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

## Elbaf Giant [Optional]

Elbaf giants are a race of massive humanoids that possess otherworldly strength and abilities. Many are dozens of feet tall and can be more than ten times the size of a regular sized person. Regular humans and non-humans are nowhere near as strong as them, making most giants some of the fiercest and deadliest warriors on the planet.

**Residents of Elbaf.** Elbaf is a large kingdom inhabited by giants, often famed for its unmatched strength when compared to other countries around the world. Many brave and nearly invincible warriors hail from here, leading many other races to either greatly fear or respect Elbaf as a whole. Having the warriors of elbaf as an ally is a surefire way to win almost any war. Even the marines often show fear of Elbaf's army, which shows how truly unmatched their warriors are.

**Super Giants.** While giants are already nearly unbeatable, the much larger *Ancient Giants* have also been rumored to have existed in the past. Due to their sheer size and strength, they are capable of sizing up battleships or even fortresses. Allegedly, some ancient giants could move entire islands or continents. These giants often stand many times taller than even the tallest ordinary giant, sometimes up to 200 feet tall. Their appearance alone has the power to send fear through any solider or pirate, often resembling a colossal ogre or oni. Very few of these giants still exist today, as many have gone extinct.


### Elbaf Giant Traits

Your giant will have these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. Your Dexterity score decreases by 2, and your Intelligence score decreases by 3.

**Age.** Giants can live for up to 300+ years.

**Alignment.** It can be assumed that many giants are neutral, but they can technically fall under any alignment.

**Size.** Giants in the One Piece World are typically 50-60 feet tall. Some can rest far outside this range, but your size will count as gargantuan.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 40 feet.

**Warrior Training.** You have proficiency with the Battleaxe, Handaxe, Light Hammer, Longsword, Club, and Spear.

**Sheer Size.** You have proficiency in the Athletics and Intimidation skills.

**Overwhelming Charisma.** Tales of you and your race's pride have spread throughout the world. Not only are you constantly oozing confidence in these things, but you can use your words to inspire and raise the spirits of your allies. Whenever you complete a Long Rest with your party, you can choose to spend 5 minutes making an inspiring speech, granting up to 5 allied creatures of your choice gain temporary HP equal to your proficiency bonus.


*(Note: Once again, this race is incredibly overpowered so I wouldn't recommend using it in a balanced campaign. However, you may still choose to include this player race in your game if you so desire. Or you can decide to use it for NPC or enemy stat sheets.)*

# Chapter 3: Classes

Pirates and explorers, driven by a desire for gold, power, and influence, aspire to reach new heights in their adventures. The morality of pirates can vary depending on the nature of your campaign, with many willing to face and overcome challenges that would deter ordinary individuals. While many powerful pirates may be primarily motivated by the pursuit of the One Piece, their fundamental driving force should be exploration and experiencing the world.

Classes shape a character's strengths, occupations, and talents as they navigate and overcome new challenges throughout their journey. They define a character's role within a crew and their relationship with the world and its inhabitants. Different classes leverage different Ability Scores, so it's wise to choose a class that aligns with your character's particular strengths and weaknesses. While many of these classes and subclasses draw heavily from those existing within the One Piece world, players are not limited to these choices. Feel free to incorporate any classes or features from the official D&D 5th Edition rules that you prefer, with DM oversight.




### Class Skill and Ability Terminology

The major distinction between a medium like D&D and One Piece is that instead of creatures utilizing magic, runes, and spellcasting, most "supernatural" or "otherworldly" powers manifest as spiritual energy or high-tech phenomena throughout the world. Consequently, you might view magic as a byproduct of scientific innovation or natural phenomena.

For instance, when considering how certain spells, like "counterspell" or "dispel magic," might function in this setting, you could interpret anyone possessing these abilities as having the capacity to drain "energy or power" from adversaries or objects.

However, to avert confusion in some sections, either set of terminology provided below may be used interchangeably. You also have the liberty to swap certain terms around in your campaign when engaging with players and the DM. The term equivalents are as follows:


Terminology Changes



Dungeons and Dragons
One Piece




Spell
Invention or Tactic


Spell (Holy or Other)
Holy or Elemental Power


Spellcasting
Special Tactics or Special Powers


Magic Item
Energy-Infused Item or a Gadget


Cantrip
Natural Ability

#### Hit Points

* (a) a pirate’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
* (a) a set of artisan’s tools or (b) a gaming set

### Scrapper 

At 1st level, your life of scrapping and battling with beasts, humans, or other tough creatures has given you mastery of Combat styles that use unarmed strikes and bruiser weapons, which are simple melee weapons without the two-handed property, cutlasses, and improvised weapons. You can not use the finesse property of a weapon while using it as a bruiser weapon.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only bruiser Weapons and you aren’t wearing armor and not wielding a shield:

* You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or bruiser weapon. This die changes as you gain bruiser levels, as shown in the scrapper column on the bruiser table.
* When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a bruiser weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike or grapple as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and Attack with a Club, you can also make an Unarmed Strike or grapple as a Bonus Action, assuming you haven’t already taken a Bonus Action this turn.

### Unarmored Defense

While you are not wearing any armor and not using a shield, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

```
```



### Fury
Starting at 2nd Level, your Training allows you to harness Fury, raw power and energy that stems from your spirit. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of Fury points. Your bruiser level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Fury Points column of the Bruiser table.

You can spend these points to fuel various Fury features. You start knowing three such features: Machine Gun Blows, Brute Force, and Brace for Impact. You learn more Fury features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a Fury point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended Fury back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest training to regain your Fury points.



Some of your Fury features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s Effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

your Constitution modifier

Immediately after you take the Attack action on Your Turn, you can spend 1 fury point to make two unarmed strikes or bruiser weapon attacks as a Bonus Action.

##### Brute Force
You can use a bonus action and expend 1 fury point to make a shove attack or take the Dash action.

##### Brace for Impact
You can use your Fury to grit your teeth and withstand physical injuries. You can use a bonus action and spend 1 fury point to prepare for any incoming attack. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your scrapper die + your bruiser level.

### Charge Right Through

At 2nd level, your spirit has grown to be able to resist harmful effects or hazards. 

So long as you have at least 1 Fury point remaining, you have advantage on constitution saving throws against traps, spells, poison, disease, or breath attacks. To gain this benefit, you can’t be Incapacitated.

### Brawling Style
At 3rd Level, you choose and develop a way of brawling that best defines your fighting style: Black Fist Style, Dragon Style, or Beast Style. all detailed at the end of the class description. Your brawling style grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in **Chapter 6**. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.



### Thrill of the Fight
At 4th level, you are filled with an overwhelming sense of reckless excitement or rage during battle. As a bonus action, you enter a bloodthirsty frenzy.

While frenzied, you gain the following benefits and downsides as long as you aren't using a shield or wearing heavy armor:

* You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
* When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed strike or bruiser weapon attack against the creature.
* Attack rolls against you have advantage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while in your frenzy.

Your frenzy lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your frenzy on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have used your frenzy a number of times equal to your Proficiency bonus, you must finish a long rest before you can enter it again.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Rampage
Starting at 5th level, you can make reckless attacks against enemies, making your fighting style a double-edged sword. When you hit a target with an unarmed strike or bruiser weapon, you can choose to deal additional damage to it equal to your scrapper die. If you do so, you must roll another scrapper die and deal the result in force damage to yourself as a part of the attack.

### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor.

```
```



### Spirit Assault
Starting at 6th level, you've instinctively learned how to incorporate a little bit of haki into your attacks. Your unarmed strikes and bruiser weapon count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.





### Frenzied Rush

At 7th level, as part of the bonus action you take to enter your frenzy, you can move up to half your speed.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your frenzy before doing anything else on that turn.



### Unbending Resolve
Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one Effect on yourself that is causing you to be Charmed or Frightened.

```



### Brutal Frenzy

At 9th level, when you are using your frenzy, you unarmed strikes and bruiser weapon deals an extra amount of damage equal to half your Proficiency bonus (rounded up).

### Unbreakable
Starting at 10th level, you don't need to have 1 fury point remaining to use the Charge Right Through feature. Additionally, you are immune to disease and poison.

### Undying Frenzy
Starting at 13th level, your frenzy keeps you fighting despite lethal injuries. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're in a frenzy and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.


### Focused Fury
Beginning at 14th level, you regain 1 expended fury point whenever you enter your frenzy.

Additionally, whenever you make any saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 Fury point to reroll it and take the second result.

### Tireless Training
Starting at 15th level, your carrying capacity is doubled. Your standard jumping distance is the same as your running start jump distance.

Additionally, when you gain a level of exhaustion from a forced march, you can choose to ignore it. You cannot use this feature this way again until you complete a long rest.





### Invincible

Beginning at 18th level, when you use your Brace for Impact fury feature during your frenzy, you now have resistance to all damage except force until the start of your next turn.

### The King
At 20th level, you are truly the strongest. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores is now 22. Additionally, when you complete a long rest you regain all expended hit dice instead of half your expended hit dice.

## Brawling Styles

Despite how easy it may be to generalize the brutish ways of a bruiser, each have a fairly distinct way of fighting. It may depend on their spirit, special attacks, or the way fury fuels their power. This comes in the form of using different fighting styles, typically representing how they were raised and taught to fight, and how they continue to train.







### Black Fist Style
Similar to how the "Black Leg Style" utilizes kicks, this style is used by those who primarily use their fists as weapons. Many who utilize this style are often feared for their display of otherworldly strength, speed, defense, and use of haki in battle. The spirit of those who use this style is often heroic, with a hint of bloodlust. Black fist style is named after the way its users coat their limbs in extremely dark and thick layers of haki.

#### Bonus Proficiency
You have trained to unlock the upper limits of your strength. You gain proficiency with the Athletics Skill. If you are already proficient, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics or Insight skill instead.

#### Demon Stance

Also at the 3rd level, you develop a demonic bloodthirst, granting you power as you rip apart your enemies. When you reduce a creature within 5 feet of you to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your Bruiser level (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

#### Haki-Coated

At 6th level, you may unlock any one "Uncommon" Color of Armament Haki Advancement feat from **Chapter 7** of this book. If you have already taken all the uncommon armament haki feats, you may take an uncommon haki advancement feat under a different color of haki, assuming you meet the prerequisites.

#### Bone Crusher
At 11th level, you can perform a variety of combat maneuvers while you are grappling an opponent within 5 feet of you:

* You can perform a mighty headbutt on a creature you are grappling. If you deal damage with an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling, their attacks will have disadvantage until the start of your next turn. You can only use this once per turn.
* You can perform a backbreaker on a creature you are grappling. If you deal damage with an unarmed strike against a creature you are grappling, you can spend 1 fury point to attempt to stun them. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be Stunned until the end of your next turn. You can only use this once per turn.
* When you take the attack action, you may spend 1 or more fury points to perform a suplex on a creature your size or larger you are grappling. They must make a Constitution saving throw against your Fury Save DC. On a failed save, the target takes the number of fury points spent + 3 scrapper die in bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone, or only takes half as much damage on a successful one. After this effect is used, the grapple ends.

#### Black Fist Master 
At 17th level, you may unlock any one "Very Rare" or lower Color of Armament Haki Advancement feat from Chapter 7. If you have already taken all the very rare and lower armament haki feats, you may take a very rare or lower haki advancement feat under a different color of haki, assuming you meet the prerequisites.

### Dragon Style
This brawling style can be best described as a fierce style that emulates the pride and might of a dragon. This style uses a mixture of Unarmed Strikes and Weapon Attacks. Users of the dragon style are fierce fighters that crush and pulverize their enemies with raw strength, guided by the wrath of a dragon spirit surrounding them. Very few have ever lived to see this style used at its full potential.

#### Dragon Stance

Starting at 3rd level, your limbs are surrounding by the aura of a mighty dragon. when you damage a target with an unarmed strike or bruiser weapon attack, you can change the damage type to fire, cold, or lightning.



#### Dragon's Breath
Also at 3rd level, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 Fury point replace one of the attacks with a burst of draconic energy in either a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide (your choice). Choose a damage type: fire, cold, or lightning. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Fury save DC, taking damage of the chosen type equal to two rolls of your Scrapper die on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

At 11th level, the damage of your breath increases to three rolls of your Scrapper die.


#### Thunderous Leap
At 6th level, you gain the blinding speed of a dragon. When you use Brute Force, instead of taking the shove attack or Dash action, you can teleport up to 30 feet toward a point you can see and gain advantage on your next attack.

#### Conqueror of Three Worlds

At 11th level, you are able to emit a larger blast of draconic energy.

As an action, you can expend 2 Fury points to hit the ground, where it erupts everything around you with energy for a brief but deadly instant.

Any creature of your choice within 20 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Fury save DC. A creature takes fire, thunder, or lightning damage equal to two scrapper die + your Constitution modiifer on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.


#### Dragon Emperor

At 17th level, when you enter into your frenzy using Thrill of the Fight, you surround yourself with an aura of draconic spirit energy for 1 minute. You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet from this aura. You can extinguish or restore the light as a Bonus Action. You gain the following abilities while this effect is active:

* If an enemy you can see hits you with an attack within 30 feet, you can use your reaction to deal a Scrapper die in fire, cold, or lightning damage to them.

* When you damage a creature with your Dragon's breath, the energy clings to the target if they failed the save. At the start of each of the creature’s turns, it takes damage of the type dealt equal to one roll of your Scrapper die. At the end of its turn, the creature can repeat the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Beast Style
Certain great fighters desire a powerful companion in battle. Bruiser that utilize the beast style have developed a special bond with nature, allowing them to tame the fearsome beasts they might find along their journey. Through mutual respect and coordination, these bruisers and their companions make for a deadly duo.

#### Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this style at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Animal Handling skill. If you are already proficient, you gain proficiency with the Nature or Survival skill instead.

#### Beast Companion
Starting at 3rd level when you learn this style, you begin to use your strength and skills to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.

With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of ฿250,000 worth of rare herbs or fine food, you discover an animal to serve as your faithful companion. You normally select you companion from among the following animals: an **ape**, a **black bear**, a **boar**, a **giant badger**, a **giant weasel**, a **mule**, a **panther**, or a **wolf**. However, your DM might also pick one of these animals for you, based on the surrounding terrain and on what types of creatures would logically be present in the area.

At the end of the 8 hours, your beast companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion’s Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.

If your beast companion is ever slain, the bond you share allows you to return it to life by reincarnating it. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of ฿250,000 worth of rare herbs or fine food, you call forth your companion’s spirit to find a new body for it. You can return a beast companion to life in this manner in any location, even without having its body with you.

If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current beast companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.

##### Companion’s Bond 
Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you. 

The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.

The companion obeys your commands as best it can. You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to verbally command your companion to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action that turn. It can also use its movement at any point during your turn. It does not have its own turn unless you are incapacitated or absent, in which case your companion acts on its own and rolls initiative. Your companion never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. You add your proficiency bonus to your companion’s AC, saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls

Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws. For each level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die determined by the creature's hit dice and increases its hit points and maximum by rolling its hit die and adding its constitution modifier to the total, then increasing its maximum hit points by that amount.

Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.

Your companion shares your interests and alignment, and has personality traits and a design of your choice (with DM assistance if required.)

#### Beast Stance

At 3rd level, you share your food, water, shelter, and training sessions with your beast companion. Additionally, you both learn to coordinate in battle using your brawling techniques. You share the following Fury abilities:

**Machine Gun Blows.** When you use this fury ability, your companion can make one or both attacks instead of you.

**Brute Force.** When you use this fury ability, your companion can take the Dash action.

**Brace for Impact.** When you gain temporary hit points from this fury ability, your companion also gains the same amount of temporary hit points.



#### Bestial Spirit Assault
At 6th level, your companion's attacks also count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.

#### Primal Coordination
Also at 6th level, you and your beast companion begin to flawlessly coordinate attacks. When you use the Attack action on your turn, if your companion can see you, it can use its reaction to make a melee attack.

#### Vicious Mauling
At 11th level, you can spend 1 Fury point as a bonus action to have your beast companion make a melee attack against each creature of its choice within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Chain Frenzy
Beginning at 17th level, when you enter your frenzy using Thrill of the Fight, your beast companion also gains certain benefits. It gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and deals an extra amount of damage on each of its attacks equal to half of your Proficiency bonus (rounded up) for 1 minute unless it falls unconscious or your frenzy ends early.

## Class Features

As a chemist, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per chemist level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per chemist level after 1st


#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields

**Weapons:** Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears

**Tools:** Herbalism kit, Alchemist's Supplies

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival



#### Equipment
You start with the following equip⁠ment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:

* (a) a shield or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon
* Thick shirt, an explorer's pack, and alchemist's supplies

### Alchemical Symbols
You understand how to read alchemical symbols written in ancient blueprints or advanced technology. These symbols are a secret code thought up by the brightest alchemists in the past, and you can quickly and intuitively understand their secret meaning. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without special powers.

### Invention Power (Spellcasting)
Drawing on the divine essence of chemical composition and alchemy, you can use various invention powers (spells) to shape that essence to your will. Invention Powers are the equivalent of "Spells" in 5th edition, and invention power slots are the same as "Spell Slots". Make sure to view the "Casting a Spell" section in the Player's Handbook for understanding Spellcasting in 5th Edition D&D. Chemist creation powers count as Chemist Spells in chapter 8.

#### Natural Abilities (Cantrips)
At 1st level, you know two natural abilities (cantrips) of your choice from the chemist spell list in chapter 8. You learn additional chemist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the natural abilities (Cantrips) Known column of the Chemist table.

```
```



#### Preparing and Casting Invention Powers (Spells)
The Chemist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your chemist invention powers (spells) of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these chemist spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of chemist invention powers (spells) that are available for you to cast, choosing from the chemist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of chemist spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Chemist level (minimum of one spell) to add to your chemist invention powers. The spells must be of a level for which you have invention power slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level chemist, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level invention power slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared invention powers can include six invention powers of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level invention power (spell) Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the invention power doesn't remove it from your list of prepared invention powers.
You can also change your list of prepared invention powers (spells) when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of chemist invention powers requires time spent in deep study: at least 1 minute per invention power level for each invention power on your list.



  



CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

#### Invention (Spellcasting) Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your chemist invention powers (spells), since your power draws upon your devotion and attunement to chemistry and science. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a chemist invention power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Invention save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Invention attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a chimest invention power (spell) as a ritual if that invention power (spell) has the ritual tag and you have the invention power prepared.

#### Invention (Spellcasting) Focus
You can use a alchemist's supplies as a spellcasting focus for your chemist Invention powers.

### Monster Mutation
Starting at 2nd level, using a chemical concoction to alter your lineage factor, you can use your action to transform yourself into the form of an abomination. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your chemist level determines the abomination you can transform into, as shown in the Abominations table. Stat blocks for Chemist abominations are available at the end of the class features.



Monster Mutations



Chemist Level
Abomination Type




2nd
Tooth Abomination


4th
Claw Abomination, Fin Abomination


8th
Wing Abomination, Beast Abomination





You can stay in your abomination form for a number of hours equal to half your chemist level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the abomination, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
* When you transform, you assume the abomination's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
* You can't cast special powers (spells), and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your abomination form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a special power (spell) you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a special power (spell), such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.
* If you have Devil Fruit powers, you cannot use them while in this form, as your lineage factor is temporarily disrupted.
* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.
	
### Chemist Study

At 2nd level, you choose to study an additional field of science alongside chemistry, incorporating the two together. Choose Botany, Medicine, or Genetics, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in Chapter 6. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Additionally, whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one natural ability (cantrip) you learned from this class's Invention Power (Spellcasting) feature with another cantrip from the chemist spell list.


CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

### Immortality Research
Starting at 18th level, the chemical knowledge that you possess allows you to develop medicine that makes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. This medicine only works on you.

### Abomination Powers
Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your invention powers (spells) in any shape you assume using your Monster Mutation. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a invention power while in an abomination form, but you aren't able to provide material components.

### Perfected Mutation
At 20th level, you can use your Monster Mutation an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your chemist invention powers (spells), as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a invention power (spell). You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your abomination form.

## Chemist Studies
All chemists spend a majority of their time studying various fields of science to incorporate into their own research. Which other field you decide to specialize in may depend on if you prefer more monstrous transformations, greater invention powers, or the ability to support your allies with chemical conconctions.

### Botany 

Botanists will often focus on the landscape and plantlife in foreign lands, enabling greater innovations and herbal remedies or concotions.

#### Bonus Natural Ability (Cantrip)
When you choose this study at 2nd level, you learn one additional chemist cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of chemist natural abilities (cantrips) you know.

#### Herbal Remedy
Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your creative energy by consuming herbal concotions you've prepared from gathering special local plants. During a short rest, you choose expended invention power slots to recover. The invention power slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your chemist level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level chemist, you can recover up to two levels worth of invention power slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.


  



CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

#### Field Invention Powers (Spells)
Your deep connection and understading of nature and plantlife enables you to advance your research far beyond ordinary levels. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to special invention powers depending on the plantlife in the region you primarily study. Choose that land – arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or underground – and consult the associated list of invention powers.

Once you gain access to a field invention power, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a invention power (spell) that doesn't appear on the chemist spell list, the spell is nonetheless a chemist invention power for you.

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the Entangle spell.

#### Botanist's Antidote
When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

#### Natural Repellent
When you reach 14th level, you develop plant-based fragrances that make wild creatures hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your chemist invention save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

### Medicine
The field of medicine allows scientists to develop a wide variety of synthetic and natural remedies alike to treat and heal those in need.


#### Healing Balm
At 2nd level, you develop a healing spray that works on allies even from a distance. You have a supply of this medicine represented by a number of d6s equal to your chemist level.

As a bonus action, you can choose an ally you can see within 120 feet of you and spend a number of those dice equal to half your chemist level or less. Roll the spent dice and add them together. The target regains a number of hit points equal to the total. The target also gains 1 temporary hit point per die spent.

You regain the expended dice when you finish a long rest.

#### Medical Tent

At 6th level, through your study of field medics, you've learned how to set up advanced tents that guard your comrades while they rest inside. During a short or long rest, you can set up a sensor that detects intruders up to a 30-foot-radius around the tent where your allies rest.

While in the sensor's radius, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the radius (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside the radius

The sensor vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the radius.

#### Instant Rescue
Starting at 10th level, you develop technology that allows you to blink over to a different point in space. As a bonus action on your turn, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, you can use your action to teleport one willing creature you touch up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Brain Imaging
At 14th level, you develop a brain imaging device that allows you to be able to enter dreams and use special powers.

When you finish a short rest, you can cast one of the following invention powers (spells), without expending a invention power slot or requiring material components: Dream (with you as the messenger) and Scrying

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Genetics
This field of science allows those who study it to heavily modify lineage factors and the genetics of living creatures. Geneticists are capable of creating a new level of mutations in their subjects.

#### Combat Mutation
When you choose this study at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Monster Mutation on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

Additionally, while you are transformed by your Monster Mutation, you can use a bonus action to expend one invention power (spell) slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the invention power slot expended.

#### Special Monster Mutations
The study of your field grants you the ability to transform into more dangerous abominations. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Monster Mutation to transform into the Claw or Beast Abomination.

Starting at 6th level, you also gain the ability to transform into special abominations listed in the below advanced table, determined by your Chemist level.



Special Monster Mutations



Chemist Level
Abomination Type




6th
Hunter Abomination


9th
Stinger Abomination


12th
Tusk Abomination


15th
Crusher Abomination


18th
Muscle Abomination





#### Monsterous Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your attacks in abomination form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Elemental Mutation
At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Monster Mutation at the same time to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a water elemental instead of an abomination.

#### Thousand Mutations
By 14th level, you have learned to use your studies to alter your physical form in more subtle ways. You can cast the Alter Self invention power (spell) at will.

CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

## Class Features

As a devilforged, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per devilforged level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per devilforged level after 1st


#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple weapons

**Tools:** One type of tool of your choice

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion



#### Equipment
You start with the following equip⁠ment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:

* (a) a musket and 20 ammunition or (b) any simple weapon
* a tool of your choice
* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* Thick shirt, any simple weapon, and two daggers

### Devil Fruit Infusion (Spellcasting)
You have mastered the art of infusing items with Devil Fruit powers through the use of "Green Blood", which you have acquired by some means. Green Blood is made up of the synthesized lineage factors of Devil Fruits, which allows you to replicate the magical powers of Devil Fruits through your equipment. Through the use of these artificially infused items, which serve as your spellcasting focus, you can use a variety of powers (spells) to aid you in battle or adventure. Devil powers are the equivalent of "Spells" in 5th edition, and devil power slots are the same as "Spell Slots". Make sure to view the "Casting a Spell" section in the Player's Handbook for understanding Spellcasting in 5th Edition D&D. Devilforged powers count as Devilforged Spells in chapter 8.

#### Natural Abilities (Cantrips)
At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the devilforged spell list in Chapter 8, and can use them as natural abilities. You learn additional devilforged cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Natural Abilities (Cantrips) Known column of the Devilforged table.

#### Devil Power (Spell) Slots
The Devilforged table shows how many Devil Power (Spell) slots you have to cast your devil powers of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your slots are the same level. To cast one of your Devil Powers of 1st level or higher, you must expend a Power (spell) slot. You regain all expended power (spell) slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level power (spell) slots. To cast the 1st-level power (spell) witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

```
```

#### Devil Powers (Spells) Known of 1st Level and Higher
At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the devilforged spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Devilforged table shows when you learn more devilforged spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new devilforged spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the devilforged spells you know and replace it with another spell from the devilforged spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Devil Power (Spellcasting) Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your devilforged spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a devilforged spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

##### Infused Item (Spellcasting Focus)
You produce your devilforged powers (spells) and effects through a special devil fruit-infused item you possess. You must have a power (spellcasting) focus - specifically some kind of weapon, armor, tool, or other item that is infused with devil fruit powers - in hand when you cast any power (spell) with this (spellcasting) feature. You must be proficient with the item to use it this way. See Chapter 5 in this book for descriptions of these items.

Once you have chosen one item or piece of equipment you wish to have infused, it becomes your power (spellcasting) focus. You cannot have more than one item infused with devil fruit powers in this way. If you wish to move the essence stored within your current infused item of choice into a new item or create a new infused item after losing your old one, you must spend 1 hour during a long rest to move the Green Blood from your old weapon into the new item and removing them from the old item. You must be proficient with this new item. In addition, you may choose to infuse items that are connected to your body, but not made of flesh. For example, a cyborg's iron fists may have devil fruit powers infused into them through green blood, without the cyborg itself having consumed a devil fruit, because they are technically not a part of the cyborg's natural body. 

Due to the infusion of multiple devil fruits' essence into your item through the use of Green Blood, the exact devil fruit power it possesses may not be clear. Instead, your item has an infusion of many different powers you have collected through researching, hunting, and foraging for devil fruits. It should not be treated as a creature that has consumed a devil fruit power, but instead as a tool that grows in power with it's user over time. In addition, the item has the weaknesses of a devil fruit user in that it cannot be used as a power (spellcasting) focus while it is more than half-submerged in water or touching seastone.



CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

### Devilsmith

At 1st level, you have developed a particular style of devilsmithing which determines the types of equipment or items you specialize at infusing with. You can choose between Gear Smithing, Blade Smithing, and Firearm Smithing, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Sea Devil's Emanations


In your exploration of the origins of Devil Fruit powers through synthesizing their lineage factors, you have uncovered the true nature of the Sea Devil's energies that imbue these powers, now capable of being released from your infused item.

At 2nd level, you gain two sea devil emanations of your choice. When you gain certain devilforged levels, you gain additional emanations of your choice, as shown in the Emanations Known column of the Devilfoged table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the emanations you know and replace it with another emanation that you could learn at that level.

### Infused Devil Fruit Category

At 3rd level, you are able to further develop the abilities of your devil fruit-infused item to closer match the abilities of a specific devil fruit category, which are paramecia, zoan, or logia. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

* **Paramecia Infusion**
 * Your infused item develops special enhanced properties, similar to that of a paramecia-type devil fruit user. You can use your action to activate an item's paramecia powers, transforming it into a weapon (unless it is already a weapon). While activated, you can choose the form that this weapon takes each time you activate it, allowing it to become any type of weapon listed in Chapter 5. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
 
 * Your infused weapon returns to your hand if it is more than 5 feet away from your for 1 minute or more. Additionally, you can return it back to its original form by deactivating its paramecia powers (no action required). Its powers disappear if you die, or if it becomes partially submerged in water or touches seastone.
 
* **Zoan Infusion**

 * Your infused item is capable of breaking a piece of itself off or stretching out, and transforms into a specific type of creature, similar to a zoan-type devil fruit user. You learn the *find familiar* spell and cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known. The familiar dissipates and returns to its original form when it becomes more than half-submerged in water or touches seastone. When the familiar disappears, the disconnected piece of your infused item returns to its original place.
 
 * When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms to better fit your item's zoan type: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Your DM may allow you to choose another form not listed here, using a custom stat block or another known creature.
 
 * Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.
 
* **Logia Infusion**

 * Your infused item is now capable of transforming itself into a specific type of element, similar to a logia-type devil fruit user. Using its powers, you are able to choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While you are holding this infused item, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the devilforged spell list, they are nonetheless Devilforged spells for you.
 
 * Choose one of the following damage types: fire, cold, lightning, radiant, necrotic, acid, poison, slashing, bludgeoning, or piercing. When you cast a cantrip using your infused item, you may choose to replace any of the cantrip's original damage types with your selected damage type, reflecting the logia element it represents. After selecting a damage type using this feature, it becomes fixed; you cannot subsequently choose a different damage type from this list to replace the damage type in your infused weapon's cantrips.
 
 * If you lose your infused item, you can telepathically will it to dematerialize into an elemental form and return to you within 1 hour. If the infused item is more than half-submerged in water or touching seastone, it cannot return to you this way. The infused item loses its elemental energy and it returns to its normal form when you die.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in Chapter 6. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Additionally, when you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing the increased power of your infused item:

* Replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Devil Fruit Infusion feature with another cantrip from the devilforged spell list.
* Replace the option you chose for the Infused Devil Fruit Category feature with one of that feature's other options.

If this change makes you ineligible for any of your Sea Devil's Emanations, you must also replace them now, choosing emanations for which you qualify.

### Fiendish Assimilation

At 11th level, your devil fruit item develops immense newfound powers. Choose one 6th-level power (spell) from the devilforged spell list as this new power.

You can cast your Fiendish Assimilation power (spell) once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more devilforged spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Fiendish Assimilation when you finish a long rest.

Alternatively, you can choose to incorporate or "steal" the essence of other great Devil Fruit powers into your infused item. When you see a Devil Fruit spell or spell effect within 30 feet of you, you may use your reaction to "store" a portion of the energy of that spell into your infused item, making it your new Fiendish Assimilation spell. The maximum level of the spell stolen must be equal to your current Fiendish Assimilation spell level. For example, if you are 13th level, you can only steal up to 7th-level spells created by a Devil Fruit power and store them into your infused item. 

If you wish to remove the stolen Devil Fruit spell and return to using your original Fiendish Assimilation spell, you must spend 1 hour during a Short or Long rest removing the essence of the stolen spell and return the power of your original chosen Fiendish Assimilation spell. You cannot use the stolen spell again once it is removed from your infused item, unless you steal it again using this feature.

### Devil's Bounty

At 20th level, you can release a surge of energy from within your Devil Fruit-infused item, allowing you to regain expended power (spell) slots. To do so, you must spend 1 minute focusing on your infused item in order to regain all your expended spell slots from your Devil Fruit Infusion (Spellcasting) feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At 1st level, you acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial melee weapons.

The experience you have gained in working with infusing various devil fruit powers into weapons has allowed you to become proficient with various weapons. When you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two-handed property. When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. If you later gain the Paramecia Infusion feature, this benefit extends to every infused weapon you enhance with that feature, no matter the weapon's type.

When you make a weapon attack on your turn against a creature, you may use a bonus action to extend its normal range by 10 ft.

Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Devil's Branding curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Devil's Branding dies, you can apply the branding to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren't incapacitated, cursing it instead. When you apply the branding in this way, you don't regain hit points from the death of the previously branded creature.

#### Exploding Shrapnel Shot

Beginning at 10th level, your Hellfire Artillery cannon can produce burning sharpnel and embers when fired. While your Hellfire Artillery cannon is active, you may use this feature to cause one of the attacks you make with your cannon to explode by spending an action on the same turn as a part of firing the cannon. Whether the cannon hits the target or not, the shot detonates as a 5th-level fireball spell (using your spell save DC) centered on the target of your attack. Any creature that fails their save against this fireball also has their movement reduced by 10 feet until the end of their turns. Additionally, you may choose to make half of the damage any creature takes from this fireball piercing or slashing instead of fire.

## Class Features

As a hybrid, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d6 per hybrid level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per hybrid level after 1st


#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, muskets

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion



#### Equipment
You start with the following equip⁠ment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:

* (a) a musket and 20 ammunition or (b) any simple weapon
* a component pouch
* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* Two daggers

### Hybrid Powers (Spellcasting)
At some point in your family tree, some interbreeding between ancient races and your own took place or an advanced team of scientists modified you from birth in a lab, integrating various lineage factors into your blood. These rare genetic qualities grant you an unknown source of energy, allowing you to use various hybrid powers (spells) to shape that energy to your will. Hybrid Powers are the equivalent of "Spells" in 5th edition, and hybrid power slots are the same as "Spell Slots". Make sure to view the "Casting a Spell" section in the Player's Handbook for understanding Spellcasting in 5th Edition D&D. Hybrid powers count as hybrid Spells in chapter 8.

#### Natural Abilities (Cantrips)
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the hybrid spell list in Chapter 8, and can use them as natural abilities. You learn additional hybrid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Natural Abilities (Cantrips) Known column of the Hybrid table.

#### Hybrid Power (Spell) Slots
The Hybrid table shows how many Hybrid Power (Spell) slots you have to cast your hybrid powers of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these hybrid powers, you must expend a slot of the power's level or higher. You regain all expended hybrid power slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level hybrid power (spell) burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level hybrid power slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.

```
```



#### Hybrid Powers (Spells) Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level hybrid powers of your choice from the hybrid spell list.

The Hybrid Powers (Spells) Known column of the Hybrid table shows when you learn more hybrid spells of your choice. Each of these hybrid powers must be of a level for which you have hybrid power slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new hybrid power of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the hybrid powers (spells) you know and replace it with another spell from the hybrid spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have hybrid power (spell) slots.

#### Hybrid Power (Spellcasting) Ability
Charisma is your hybrid (spellcasting) ability for your hybrid powers, since the power of your power relies on your ability to project your inner strength into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a hybrid power (spell) you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Hybrid save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Hybrid attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Hybrid Power (Spellcasting) Focus
You can use a hybridized part of your body as a spellcasting focus for your hybrid powers (spells).


  




CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### Hybrid Lineage
Choose a hybrid lineage, which describes the source of your innate power. Choose the Seraphim, Germa, or Beast Lineage, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Hybrid Enchantments
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of power within yourself, formed from advanced lineage factors. This wellspring is represented by Hybrid Points, which allow you to create a variety of special effects.

* **Hybrid Points.** You have 2 hybrid points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Hybrid Points column of the Hybrid table. You can never have more hybrid points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent hybrid points when you finish a long rest.
* **Flexible Powers.** You can use your hybrid points to gain additional hybrid power (spell) slots, or sacrifice hybrid power slots to gain additional hybrid points. You learn other ways to use your hybrid points as you reach higher levels.
	* **Creating Hybrid Power (Spell) Slots.** You can transform unexpended hybrid points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Hybrid Power Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create hybrid power slots no higher in level than 5th. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.
	* **Converting a Hybrid Power (Spell) Slot to Hybrid Points.** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of hybrid points equal to the slot's level.

### Power Enhancements
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your hybrid powers (spells) to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Enhancements options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Enhancement option on a hybrid power (spell) when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

* **Careful Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the hybrid's full force. To do so, you spend 1 hybrid point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the hybrid power.
* **Distant Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 hybrid point to double the range of the hybrid power.
	* When you cast a hybrid power that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 hybrid point to make the range of the hybrid power 30 feet.
* **Empowered Enhancement.** When you roll damage for a hybrid power, you can spend 1 hybrid point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.
	* You can use Empowered Enhancement even if you have already used a different Enhancement option during the casting of the hybrid power.
* **Extended Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 hybrid point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
* **Heightened Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 hybrid points to give one target of the hybrid power disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the hybrid power.
* **Quickened Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 hybrid points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.
* **Seeking Enhancement.** If you make an attack roll for a hybrid power and miss, you can spend 2 hybrid points to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.
	* You can use Seeking Enhancement even if you have already used a different Enhancement option during the casting of the hybrid power.
* **Seeking Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that requires you to make a hybrid attack roll or that forces a target to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 hybrid point to ignore the effects of half- and three-quarters cover against targets of the hybrid power.
* **Subtle Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power, you can spend 1 hybrid point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.
* **Transmuted Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 hybrid point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.
* **Twinned Enhancement.** When you cast a hybrid power that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of hybrid points equal to the hybrid power's level to target a second creature in range with the same hybrid power (1 hybrid point if the hybrid power is a cantrip). To be eligible, a hyrbid power must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the hybrid power's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.

```



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in Chapter 6. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Additionally, when you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can do one of the following, representing the power within you flowing in new ways:

* Replace one of the options you chose for the Enhancement feature with a different Enhancement option available to you.
* Replace one natural ability (cantrip) you learned from this class' spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the hybrid spell list.

### Hybrid Resilience  
When you reach 5th level, you can tap into your special genetic traits to try and conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 hybrid point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.

### Hybrid Restoration
At 20th level, you regain 4 expended hybrid points whenever you finish a short rest.

## Hybrid Lineage

Hybrids may have any number of lineage factors packed into them. However, whichever lineage is dominant in your gene pool will determine your Hybrid Lineage.

### Seraphim Lineage

Hybrids infused with Seraphim lineage have genetic traits inherited primarily from Lunarians. These lineage factors make them incredible durable and proficient with fire-based abilities.

#### Lunarian Blessing

At 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Angelic Resilience
As ancient blood flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your lunarian ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, you gain glowing yellow eyes, black feathers and small flickers of fire sprouting from your back, and darkened skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.



  



CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

#### Flame Affinity
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a Hybrid Power (Spell) that deals fire damage, add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that hybrid power. At the same time, you can spend 1 hybrid point to gain resistance to fire damage for 1 hour.

#### Celestial Wings

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of black feathered wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

#### Heavenly Presence
Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the overwhelming presence of your Seraphim blood, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 hybrid points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

### Germa Lineage
Your lineage factors have been modified by the Germa Kingdom and their top scientists. As a result, you have been granted increased strength, durability, and speed since birth to serve their militaristic empire.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.

#### Elemental Powers
Your affinity for elemental powers grants you the option to learn some non-hybrid spells that focus on weapon attacks. When your Hybrid Power (Spellcasting) feature lets you learn a hybrid spell of 1st level or higher, you can select the spell from the following list of germa powers (spells), in addition to the hybrid spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a Hybrid Power (spell) for you.

```

#### Soldier's Durability
At 1st level, your germa lineage gives you extra fortitude. Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

As an action, you can gain a base AC of 13 + your Constitution modifier if you aren’t wearing armor, and your skin and bones have the consistency of steel and appears dented when damaged. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield.


  



CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

#### Elemental Absorption

At 6th-level, you have learned to absorb certain elemental effects. Choose between fire, lightning, thunder, and poison. You know have resistance to the chosen damage type. Additionally, whenever you are damaged by the chosen damage type, the next hybrid power (spell) you cast against an enemy deals additional damage equal to 1d6 of the chosen damage type.

This damage die increases to a d8 at the 14th level and a d10 at the 18th level.

#### Modified Flesh

Beginning at 14th level, you can unleash the germa 66 lineage factors that lie dormant in your body. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more hybrid points to transform your body for 10 minutes. For each hybrid point you spend, you can gain one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last until the transformation ends:

* You can see any invisible creature within 60 feet of you, provided it isn't behind total cover. Your eyes also turn red and form a crosshair around your pupils.
* You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. As you fly, your feet or shoes emit short bursts of air.
* You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed, and you can breathe underwater.
* Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slick and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.


#### Warping Implosion
At 18th level, you can unleash your hidden germa abilities, granting you the ability to use a space-warping dash. As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. Immediately after you disappear, each creature within 30 feet of the space you left must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d10 force damage and is pulled straight toward the space you left, ending in an unoccupied space as close to your former space as possible. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 hybrid points to use it again.

### Beast Lineage
Your body has been modified or influenced by beast-like lineage factors since birth. You may have a number of altered appendages resembling that of a beast. Additionally, your skin may slowly grow scales, feathers, or fur, depending on what beast traits you inherited.


```
```



### Animalistic Traits
At 1st level, choose one of the following mutations you inherit:

* You have the ability to breathe underwater, and you have a swim speed equal to your walking speed. You also grow gills from the back of your neck or behind your ears, your fingers become webbed, and you grow lasting cilia that extend through your clothing.
* You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. Also, your arms become feathered and wing-like, and your legs harden and contort to become talon-like.
* Your walking speed permanently increases to 35 feet. Additionally, you can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. You also grow a patchy fur coat or another mammalian feature.

### Sharpened Vision

From 1st level, as you develop animal-like vision, you gain darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you learn the See Invisibility spell, which doesn't count against your number of hybrid spells known. In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 hybrid points or by expending a spell slot.


### Bestial Defense
At 6th level, you gain resistance to psychic damage, as your instincts make your mind too sturdy to influence.

You also gain the ability to defend yourself by making a sudden escape away from danger. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack and take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from it, you can reduce that damage by an amount equal to your hybrid level plus your Charisma score, and then you can move up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. Once you use this special reaction, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Flexible Body
Starting at 14th level, when you move on your turn, you take only half damage from opportunity attacks, and you can move through any enemy’s space but can’t willingly end your move there.

On your turn, you can move through any space that is at least 3 inches in diameter and do so without squeezing. When you stop moving, the regular squeezing rules apply if you’re in a space one size smaller than you. You can’t willingly stop in a space smaller than that, and if you’re forced to do so, you immediately flow to the nearest space that can fit you, back along the path of your movement.


### Final Evolution
Starting at 18th level, your being is fully altered by the power of the wild, making your body far more resilient than an ordinary creature. You gain the following benefits:

* You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep.
* A critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.
* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check that uses the chosen proficiency instead

### Lock-On

Beginning at 1st level, you focus your aim and killing intent onto one creature to target their weak points. When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a firearm or sling, you can mark the target for 1 minute.

The first time on each of your turns that you hit the marked enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you increase that damage by 1d4.

You can use this feature to mark a creature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.


### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty: choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

```
```



##### Close Quarters Shooter

When making a ranged attack with a firearm or sling while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks with a firearm or sling ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks with a firearm or sling.

##### Deadeye

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with firearm or sling weapons. This effect does not stack with the Archery fighting style.

##### Sharpened Shot

You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls you make using firearms or slings. 


##### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting with at least one pistol, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.


### Special Tactics (Spellcasting)
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use special tactics and abilities to better deal with your targets. Special tactics are the equivalent of "Spells" in 5th edition, and tactic slots are the same as "Spell Slots". Make sure to view the "Casting a Spell" section in the Player's Handbook for understanding Spellcasting in 5th Edition D&D. Marksman tactics count as Marksman Spells in chapter 8.

#### Tactic Slots (Spell Slots)
The Marksman table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Marksman tactics of 1st level and higher. To use one of these tactics, you must expend a slot of the tactics's level or higher. You regain all expended tactic slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level tactic Snare and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level tactic slot available, you can cast Snare using either slot.

#### Tactics Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level tactics of your choice, taken from from the marksman spell list.

The Tactics Known column of the Marksman table shows when you learn more marksman tactics of your choice. The term "tactic level" is equivalent to "spell level". Each of these tactics must be of a level for which you have tactic slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new tactic of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the marksman tactics you know and replace it with another from the marksman spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have tactic slots.



CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

#### Special Tactic Ability (Spellcasting Ability)
Wisdom is your special tactic ability for your marksman tactics, since your skills come from your attunement to your surroundings. You use your Wisdom whenever a tactic (spell) refers to your special tactic (spellcasting) ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a marksman tactic you use and when making an attack roll with one.

**Tactic save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Tactic attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier


### Gunsmith

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Tinker's Tools to craft any type of nonmagical firearm or sling and ammunition for a weapon you possess by spending half of the standard cost listed in Chapter 5. During a successful long rest, you must have spent at least 1 hour during it to completely build one firearm or up to five pieces of ammunition. You cannot repeat this process until the next time you complete a long rest.




### Marksman Archetypes

At 3rd level, you choose the archetype that best suits your own style and profession. Choose the Gunslinger, Sniper, or Bounty Hunter, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you a unique feature when you choose it at 3rd level. It also grants you additional benefits at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.


### Prey Awareness

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action to expend 1 Tactic Slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per Tactic Slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you: aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

Additionally, you may select one creature you have seen before when you activate this feature. While this feature is active, you know if the target creature is within 1 mile of you, but not its exact location.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in **Chapter 6**. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Expert Reload
At 4th level, choose one type of firearm you possess. You ignore the loading properties of only that firearm type (such as bazooka). You can choose a different firearm type when you gain an extra level in this class.



### Extra Attack

Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Greater Lock-On

At 6th level, you can add your wisdom modifier to the damage dealt by Lock-On.

Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a creature with lock-on applied to it.

### Fleet of Foot

Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.


  





CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

### Trick Shot

Starting at 10th level, once per turn you can target a specific location on a foe's body, so long as the foe's body has the location you want to target. When you hit with with a firearm or sling attack, you may add an additional effect based on the targeted location. A target creature hit by must make a saving throw against your Tactic save DC. 

**Armshot.** On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop a single held item of your choice.

**Bodyshot.** On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or has disadvantage on all Dexterity saving throws and cannot speak until the start of your next turn. 

**Headshot.** On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become disoriented, as if affected by the Confusion spell, until the start of your next turn.

**Legshot.** On a hit, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall prone.

**Wingshot.** On a hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw or have its flying speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn.

You may add a trick shot effect a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses when you finish a long rest. At the 20th level, you may a trickshot an unlimited amount of times, but only once per turn.

### Silencer Shot

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail, and the sound of your firearms do not immediately give away your exact location.

### Ascended Awareness

Starting at 18th level, you may unlock any one "Very Rare" or lower Color of Observation Haki Advancement feat from Chapter 7. If you have already taken all the very rare and lower observation haki feats, you may take a very rare or lower haki advancement feat under a different color of haki, assuming you meet the prerequisites.

### One Shot One Kill

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled marksman. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature marked by your Lock-On feature with a firearm or sling, you can choose to attempt to execute the creature instead of dealing extra damage to it. If the creature has 30 or less hit points after your attack's initial damage has already been dealt, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Tactic save DC or it dies instantly.

```
```



## Marksman Archetypes
Marksmen are renowned for their steady aim and impressive gun or sling training. What separates them is their ability to fire quickly, snipe at a distance, or effectively hunt their targets.

### Gunslinger

Gunslingers are noted for their speed and skill in handling and shooting their weapons. They shoot to kill, and rarely miss. 

#### Quick-draw

At 3rd level, you master the art of quickly drawing your weapon at the start of battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Wisdom modifier.

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If you take the Attack action with a sling or firearm on that turn, you can make one additional weapon with a sling or firearm attack as part of that action. If that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's damage type.


#### Gunslinger Tactics

From 3rd level, you have darkvision with a range of 90 feet. You also gain access to additional tactics at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 15th level. You are always able to use these tactics, and they do not count against your number of Marksman tactics known.

#### Quick-Step
At 15th level, you master the ability to disrupt and maneuver around an opponent's attacks. If a creature attacks you and does not have advantage on the attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant it disadvantage on the attack roll. You must use this ability before you know the result of the attack.

### Sniper

Snipers are marksmen that try to maximize their range and stealth when hunting a target using camoflauge and distance. They will rarely ever be spotted or caught out when gunning down their prey from a safe location. These marksmen are horrifying to deal with from far away.

#### Scoping

At 3rd level, your range with firearms and slings becomes 150/600 feet unless its already a greater amount. 

#### Empowered Bullet

Starting at 3rd level, you learn to craft special bullets using your gunsmithing abilities.

When you hit with a firearm or sling attack, you can expend a Tactic Slot to deal additional damage to a target. The extra damage is equal to 1d6 for a 1st-level Tactic Slot, plus 1d6 for each Tactic Slot higher than 1st, up to a maximum of 5d6.

#### Vantage Point

Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

#### Sniper's Support
At 11th level, you can support and draw attention away from your allies while they are fighting your target up close. When a creature is marked by your Lock-On, allied creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it until the mark ends. Additionally, the marked creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, becoming clearly outlined.

#### Counter-Snipe

At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If a creature marked with Lock-On forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If the attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.

### Bounty Hunter

Bounty hunters excel at hunting a single target for the purposes of cashing in their bounty. 



#### Bounty Hunter Tactics

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional tactic when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Bounty Hunter Tactics table. The tactic counts as a marksman tactic for you, but it doesn't count against the number of marksman tactics you know.

#### Hunter's Sense
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to peer at a creature and magically discern how best to hurt it. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. You immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

#### Bounty's Brand

Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your ire on one foe, increasing the harm you inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. The first time each turn that you hit that target with a weapon attack, it takes an extra 1d6 damage from the weapon.

This benefit lasts until you finish a short or long rest. It ends early if you designate a different creature. When you defeat or kill a creature with a Bounty's Brand on its head, you gain an additional 10% reward from collecting its bounty.

#### Stalker's Caution
At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever a creature marked by your Bounty's Brand forces you to make a saving throw and whenever you make an ability check to escape that target's grapple, add 1d6 to your roll.

#### Tactical Counter
At 11th level, you gain the ability to thwart someone else's tactics (magic). When you see a creature using a tactic (casting a spell) or teleporting within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to try to foil it. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Tactic save DC, or its tactic (spell) or teleport fails and is wasted.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Professional Hunter
At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your target tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Bounty's Brand forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against the quarry. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If the attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.

## Class Features
As a martial artist, you gain the following class features.



#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per martial artist level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per martial artist level after 1st



#### Proficiencies
**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, shortswords

**Tools:** Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical Instrument

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Dexterity

**Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth





#### Equipment
You start with the following equip⁠ment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:

* (a) a shortsword or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a pirate’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
* (a) 10 darts or (b) two daggers





### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a Shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.

### Martial Arts
At 1st level, your practice of Martial Arts gives you mastery of Combat styles that use unarmed strikes and martial artist Weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons⁠ that don’t have the Two-Handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only martial artist Weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

* You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the Attack and Damage Rolls of your unarmed strikes and martial artist Weapons.
* You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or martial artist weapon. This die changes as you gain martial artist levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Martial Artist table.
* When you use the Attack action with an Unarmed Strike or a martial artist weapon on Your Turn, you can make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action. For example, if you take the Attack action and Attack with a Quarterstaff, you can also make an Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action, assuming you haven’t already taken a Bonus Action this turn.

Certain martial arts schools use specialized forms of the martial artist Weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a Sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a martial artist weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

### Unarmored Movement⁠
Starting at 2nd Level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain martial artist levels, as shown in the Martial Artist table.



### Ki
Starting at 2nd Level, your training allows you to harness The Spiritual energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your martial artist level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Martial Artist table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Swift Barrage, Shifting Body, and Whirlwind Step. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or Long Rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s Effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Ki save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus +
your Wisdom modifier

#### Swift Barrage
Immediately after you take the Attack action on Your Turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a Bonus Action.

#### Shifting Body
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a Bonus Action on Your Turn.

#### Whirlwind Step
You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage and Dash action as a Bonus Action on Your Turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

### Soul Weapon

Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as martial artist weapons, not just simple melee weapons and shortswords. Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it, and then count that weapon as a martial artist weapon until you use this feature again.

The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:

* The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
* You must be proficient with it.
* It must lack the heavy and special properties.

### Martial Arts School
When you reach 3rd Level, you commit yourself to a school of martial arts: Six Powers, Fish-Man Karate, or New Kama Kenpo, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your school grants you features at 3rd Level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

### Deflect Projectile

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect ranged attacks that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your martial artist level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can spend 1 ki point to redirect the attack toward another creature. If you do so, choose a creature within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind Total Cover. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

### Ki-Fueled Attack

Also at 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or a martial artist weapon as a bonus action before the end of the turn.


### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in **Chapter 6**. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

```



### Slow Fall

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your martial artist level.

Beginning at 5th Level, you can Attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on Your Turn.

### Stunning Strike
Starting at 5th Level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon Attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a Stunning Strike.

Beginning at 5th level,  when you miss with an attack roll, you can spend 1 to 3 ki points to increase your attack roll by 2 for each of these ki points you spend, potentially turning the miss into a hit.

### Solar Plexus Chakra
Starting at 6th level, through control over your solar plexus chakra, your Unarmed Strikes can deal Force damage or its normal damage type (your choice).




CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### Evasion
At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area Effects, such as an exploding missile. When you are subjected to an Effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Stomach Chakra

Starting at 7th level, through control over your stomach chakra, if you spend at least 1 minute resting, you can give yourself all the benefits of a Short Rest. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

### Acrobatic Movement

At 9th level, while you aren't wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

### Root Chakra

At 10th level, through control over your root chakra, you can use a Bonus Action to remove one of the following conditions from yourself: Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned.

In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn't give you levels of exhaustion.

### Throat Chakra
Starting at 13th level, through control over your throat chakra, you gain the ability to communicate using your mind and spirit to connect with others and understand their intent. You gain telepathy up to 30 feet.

### Deflect Energy

At 13th level, you can now use your Deflect Missiles feature against a ranged attack that deals any type of damage.


```
```




### Crown Chakra
Beginning at 14th level, through control over your crown chakra, you gain proficiency in all Saving Throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.



### Sacral Chakra
At 15th level, through control over your sacral chakra, when you roll Initiative and have 3 Ki Points or fewer, you regain expended Ki Points until you have 4.

### Third Eye Chakra

Beginning at 18th level, through control over your third eye chakra, you can use your action to spend 3 ki points to perfectly brace yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. During that time, you have resistance to all damage except force damage.

### Death Chakra
At 20th level, if you drop to 0 hit points, you can spend 4 ki points, roll four Martial Arts dice, and add the dice together. Your number of Hit Points instead changes to the total rolled.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the ki point cost increases by 2. When you finish a Short Rest or Long Rest, the Ki Point cost resets to 4.







CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

## Martial Arts Schools

There are several different schools that teach martial arts. Although anyone strong enough can learn from these schools in theory, only a select group can successfully enter and learn these ways of fighting. Six Powers, Fish-Man Karate, or New Kama Kenpo are your choices.

### Six Powers
Six Powers is a special, superhuman martial arts style utilized by many trained government assassins and agents. Those that master this style can have the strength of up to a hundred men. Though this style often requires intense training from a young age, some can learn certain parts of the six powers with enough intense training at a later age. Most users of the six powers belong to the World Government and Navy, though rarely some pirates and other factions have been shown to know it.

#### Finger Pistol
Starting at 3rd Level, your fingers become as sharp as daggers. When you make an unarmed strike, you can choose to use piercing damage for the damage type.

#### Tempest Kick
Also at 3rd level, you can make ranged air slices with your legs or other available limbs. This special attack is a sharp compressed air slice used as a ranged spell Attack with a range of 30 feet, in place of your unarmed strike or martial artist weapon attack. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its Attack and Damage Rolls. Its damage is slashing, and its damage die is a d6. This die changes as you gain martial artist levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Martial Artist table. 

You can only replace one melee attack with this special attack per turn. When you gain the Extra Attack feature, you can replace two attacks with this special attack per turn instead. When you take the attack action, you can expend 1 ki point to be able to replace all of your melee attacks with this special attack during your turn.

At 6th level, you can deal force damage with Tempest Kick instead of slashing.

#### Iron Body and Paper Art

Starting at 6th level, your muscles become stronger than steel. Your Deflect Bullets feature can now work against melee attacks that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage.

You can use this feature this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. While you have no uses available, you can spend 1 additional ki point to use this feature again.

Additionally, if you reduce the damage of a melee attack to 0 with this feature, you can completely shift your body to redirect the attack toward another enemy by spending 1 ki point as part of the same reaction. By redirecting the attack, you can force it to hit a creature of your choice, other than the attacker, within 5 feet of you.

```
```



#### Shave

Starting at 11th level, you gain the ability to move or fly at extremely high speeds, appearing to teleport. You can use a Bonus Action to teleport⁠ up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see⁠. You then have advantage on the first melee Attack you make before the end of the turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. After you've expended all these uses, you can only use Shave again by spending 1 ki point to activate it. You regain all uses of this feature after you complete a long rest.

#### Moon Walk

Also at 11th level, when you use your Whirlwind Step, you can now kick the air with such force that you begin to propel yourself. While you do this, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your next turn.

Additionally, using the Slow Fall feature now reduces any Falling damage you take to 0.

#### Six King Gun

At 17th level, you learn the secret seventh technique of the Six Powers. When you hit a creature with an Unarmed strike within 5 feet of you, you can spend 3 ki points to force it to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 force damage. Until the end of your next turn, you can't take an Action on your turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over you.




CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### Fish-Man Karate

Through mastery of fish-man karate, which is often used alongside fish-man jujutsu, you begin to learn how to control the water around you and within your opponent's body. Water can be drawn and manipulated anywhere, even the atmosphere, to emit devastating shockwaves of energy that can even affect devil fruit users. This martial arts is learned primarily by fish-men, but can also be learned by humans or other races occasionally. It would be unthinkable to learn this style of martial arts as a devil fruit user.

#### Water Adept

Starting at 3rd level, your strikes, whether you're on land or in seawater, are now infused with the water around you. When you make a melee weapon attack, you can choose to use cold damage for the damage type.

```
```



#### Arabesque Tile True Punch

Starting at 3rd Level, you can manipulate and control the direction of water in and around your enemy's body. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Swift Barrage, you can impose one of the following Effects on that target:

* It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
* It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.
* It can’t take Reactions until the end of your next turn.

#### Five Thousand Tile True Punch

At 6th level, you gain the ability to channel your ki into devastating waves of water-infused energy. Immediately after you take the Attack action on Your Turn, as a bonus action, you can spend 2 ki points to force each creature in a 15-foot cone to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Ki Save DC. A creature takes three Martial Arts dice in cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can spend additional ki points to add an additional one Martial Arts die to the damage. 

#### Wrath of the Sea
Also at 6th level, your attacks made with your unarmed strikes, martial artist weapon, or martial artist spells deal additional cold damage equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up).

#### Sharkskin Palm Block

At 11th level, the power of your water-infused ki now radiates from you, protecting your allies from harm and punishing any who raise arms against them. As a bonus action, you can take a defensive stance to create a protective aura of water that emerges 30 feet from you for 1 minute. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage, and for the duration, you gain the following effects:


* You and your allies within your aura gain resistance to the chosen damage type.
* Waves of water-infused aura flow out from you and your allies when any of you are attacked. When you or one of your allies in the aura is hit by an attack made by another creature within the aura, the target of the attack can use their reaction to deal an amount of cold damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die to the attacker.

Once you use this bonus action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend 4 ki points to use it again.

#### Shark Pack Attack

At 17th level, you can release a pack of watery sharks that tear apart any creatures they catch. As an action, you can spend up to any number of ki points and conjure a number of shark projectiles equal to ki points spent to hurl at targets within 120 feet of you. You can hurl them at one target or several. Make a ranged spell attack for each shark using your proficiency bonus + Wisdom modiifer for the attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes 2 Martial Arts die in cold damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn, when the sharks evaporate.





CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### New Kama Kenpo
New Kama Kenpo is the ultimate form of fighting used by the 99 masters of New Kama Kenpo and their Queen from Kamabakka Kingdom. This style has inspired other similar forms and schools of martial arts, but is considered the strongest of its kind. It is largely used by those who consider themselves "Okamas", but it can be learned by anyone who dedicates themselves to the teachings of this martial arts.

#### Okama Way

When you choose this school at 3rd Level, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill and disguise kits if you don’t already have it as your Martial Arts technique mixes Combat Training with the precision of a dancer and the flashy abilities of the Okama.

In addition, your performances become more and more fabulous along with your appearance. When you make a Charisma check while dressed up as an okama, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the result.

#### Spinning Spa
Starting at 3rd level, you learn how to spin and dance gracefully as part of your Swift Barrage. Whenever you use Swift Barrage, you gain the benefit of the Disengage action, and your walking speed increases by 20 feet until the end of your turn.

#### Kick Claw First Pointe
Beginning at 6th level, you can leap to intercept the movement of an enemy during battle. When a creature moves within 15 feet of you for the first time during its turn, you can use your reaction to spin or flip and leap up to 15 feet toward a space adjacent to it. If you do, you make an unarmed attack against the creature immediately at the end of the movement. If you hit, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn. If the creature is in the air, it also falls to the ground.

#### Awakening of the Maiden

Starting at 11th level, you can always spin in and out of danger at the right moment. When you make an ability check, an Attack roll, or a saving throw and have disadvantage on the roll, you can spend 2 ki points to cancel the disadvantage for that roll.

Additionally, when you’re prone, you can choose to stand up on your turn without spending half your movement.

#### Galaxy Spin
Starting at 17th level, whenever you use your Swift Barrage, you create a number of spinning afterimages that make you more difficult to hit and allow you make an extra attack. When you use your Swift Barrage, you can make an additional attack with it (up to a total of three Swift Barrage attacks). Also, whenever you hit an enemy with your Swift Barrage, they have disadvantage on attacks against you until the end of their next turn.

CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### Class Features
As a Priest, you gain the following Class Features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Priest level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Priest level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light⁠ armor, Medium Armor, Shields

**Weapons:** Simple Weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma

**Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

#### Equipm⁠ent
You start with the following equip⁠ment, in addition to the equi⁠pment⁠ granted by your background:

* (a) a mace or (b) a Warhammer (if proficient)
* (a) Scale Mail, (b) Thick Shirt, or (c) Chain Mail (if proficient)
* (a) a Musket and 20 gun bullets or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
* A Shield and a holy symbol⁠

### Holy Power (Spellcasting⁠)
As a conduit for divine energy, you can cast Priest Holy Powers (Spells). Priest holy powers count as Priest Spells in chapter 8. 

#### Natural Abilities (Cant⁠rips)
At 1st Level, you know three Cantrips of your choice from the Priest spell list. You learn additional Priest cant⁠rips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Natural Abilities Known (Can⁠trips Known) column of the Priest table.



#### Preparing and Casting Holy Powers (Spells)
The Priest table shows how many Holy Power Slots (Spell Slots) you have to cast your Priest Holy Powers of 1st Level and higher. To cast one of these holy powers⁠, you must expend a slot of the holy power’s level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

You prepare the list of Holy Powers (Spells) that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Priest spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Priest holy powers⁠ equal to your Wisdom modifier + your Priest level (minimum of one holy power). The holy power⁠ must be of a level for which you have Holy Power Slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level Priest, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Holy Power Slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared Holy Powers can include six holy powers⁠ of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level holy power (spell) Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the holy power doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared holy powers.

You can change your list of prepared holy powers when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Priest holy powers⁠ requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per Holy Power Level for each holy power on your list.

#### Special Power⁠ Ability (Spellcasting)
Wisdom is your Special Power (Spellcasting) ability for your Priest Holy Powers (Spells). The strength of your holy powers⁠ comes from your devotion to your God. You use your Wisdom whenever a Priest holy power (spell) refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a Priest holy power you cast and when making an Attack roll with one.

**Holy Power save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Holy Power Attack modifier** = your Proficiency Bonus +
your Wisdom modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a Priest holy power as a ritual if that holy power has the ritual tag and you have the holy power prepared.

#### Special Power Focus (Spellcasting Focus)
You can use a holy symbol⁠ as a special power focus for your Priest Holy Powers.

### Divine Domain
Choose one domain related to your teachings: Sky, Desert, or Death. Your choice grants you domain Spells and other features when you choose it at 1st Level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd Level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

#### Domain Holy Powers (Spells)
Each domain has a list of holy powers (spells)—its domain holy powers—that you gain at the Priest levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain holy power, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of Holy Powers you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain holy power (spell) that doesn’t appear on the Priest spell list, the holy power is nonetheless a Priest holy power for you.

### Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel special powers. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your priest holy power save DC.





CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

```
```



### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in **Chapter 6**. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Additionally, whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one natural ability (cantrip) you learned from this class's Special Ability feature with another cantrip from the priest spell list.

### Destroy Undead
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.


Destroy Undead



Priest Level
Destroys Undead of CR...




5th
1/2 or lower


8th
1 or lower


11th
2 or lower


14th
3 or lower


17th
4 or lower





### Blessed Strikes

When you reach 8th level, you are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal 1d8 radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

	
### A Call Beyond
Beginning at 10th level, you can channel your God's spirit directly through you to summon it and wish for greater power.

Channeling this divine energy to make a wish requires an action. Describe the effect you want, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your Priest level, your wish comes true. The DM chooses the Nature of the wish; the Effect of any Priest spell or Priest domain spell would be appropriate.

If this effect succeeds, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a Long Rest.

At 20th level, your Call Beyond succeeds automatically, no roll required.

## Divine Domains

Divine domains are used to define your god, religion, and spiritual beliefs. These are important to how your spirit shapes your powers and abilities by channeling divine energy from the beyond.

### Sky Domain
Many priests under the Sky Domain hail from the sky islands and the various holy lands that can be found around them. Priests here primarily derive their power from Mantra and Dials to become powerful fighters. 



Sky Domain Holy Powers (Spells)

#### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with Dials, Martial Weapons, and Heavy Armor.

#### Thunderous Dial Strike
Also at 1st level, you can thunderously rebuke attackers with dials built into your clothing or gear. When a creature within 5 feet of you that you can see hits you with an Attack, you can use your Reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath
Starting at 2nd Level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of your dials with unchecked ferocity.

When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling.




#### Dial Ritual
At 6th level, you may occasionally manufacture Dials of your own. You may spend 24 hours touching and altering a normal shell as a ritual to turn it into a powerful Dial. When the 24 hours are over, roll on the Rare Dial Table in Chapter 5. The shell you are holding becomes that Dial.

You cannot perform this ritual again until you reach the 8th, 11th, 14th, or 17th levels. You can only perform this ritual once during each of those levels, and it must be used to transform your current ritually created dial into a new dial by rolling on the Rare Dial Table to change its effects into something different.

```
```



#### Dial Infusion
At 8th level, you gain the ability to combine your weapon strikes with dial-infused power. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon Attack, you can cause the Attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Dial Glide
At 17th level, you can use dials to give you a flying speed equal to your current walking speed whenever you are not Underground or indoors.




CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### Desert Domain
Fierce holy warriors of the desert, defenders of sacred land, priests of the desert domain often reside in various kingdoms of the desert.

#### Bonus Natural Ability (Cantrip)
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the light natural ability (cantrip) if you don’t already know it.

#### Blinding Sands
Also at 1st level, you can whirl up a sandstorm between yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your Reaction to impose disadvantage on the Attack roll, causing sand to momentarily blind the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be Blinded is immune to this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Scorching Sun
Starting at 2nd Level, you can use your Channel Divinity to harness scorching sunlight, banishing darkness⁠ and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

As an action, you present your holy symbol⁠, and any magical darkness⁠ within 30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each Hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your Priest level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you is not affected.

#### Crippling Sands
Starting at 6th level, you can also use your Blinding Sands feature when a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other than you.

#### Rising Heat
Starting at 8th level, you add fire or radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any priest cantrip.

#### Desert Aura
Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sunlight and burning sands that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on Saving Throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.

### Death Domain

Devout worshippers of Death, the Reaper, the Devil, and all that brings about ruin and despair, priests that fall under this domain are blessed by the powers of negative energy and forces that cause death.

#### Bonus Proficiency
When the Priest chooses this domain at 1st level, he or she gains proficiency with Martial Weapons.

#### Reap
At 1st level, the Priest learns one Necromancy natural ability (cantrip) of his or her choice from any spell list. When the Priest casts a Necromancy cantrip that normally Targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

#### Channel Divinity: Sudden Decay
Starting at 2nd Level, the Priest can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature’s life force by touch.

When the Priest hits a creature with a melee Attack, the Priest can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice his or her Priest level.

#### Withering Grasp
Starting at 6th level, the priest’s ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by the character’s Priest Holy Powers and Channel Divinity options ignores Resistance to necrotic damage.

#### Siphoning Strike
At 8th level, the Priest gains the ability to infuse his or her weapon strikes with necrotic energy. Once on each of the priest’s turns when he or she hits a creature with a weapon Attack, the Priest can cause the Attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When the Priest reaches 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

#### Improved Reap
Starting at 17th level, when the Priest casts a Necromancy holy power (spell) of 1st through 5th Level that Targets only one creature, the holy power can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the holy power consumes its Material Components, the Priest must provide them for each target.

### Class Features
As a Rogue, you gain the following Class Features.

#### Hit Points
**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per rogue level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor

**Weapons:** Simple Weapons, pistols, longswords, rapiers, shortswords

**Tools:** Thieves’ tools

**Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence

**Skills:** Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth
#### Equipment
You start with the following Equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:
* (a) a Rapier or (b) a Shortsword
* (a) a Musket and 20 gun bullets or (b) a Shortbow and Quiver of 20 Arrows
* (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an explorer’s pack
* Thick Shirt, two daggers, and thieves’ tools

### Expertise
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

### Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

### Thieves' Cant

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.



### Roguish Archetype
At 3rd Level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Swashbuckler, Thief, or Elemental Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd Level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Steady Aim

At 3rd level, as a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in **Chapter 6**. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.




### Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.



### Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area Effects, such as a devil fruit user's fireball ability or an Ice Storm attack. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.



### Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.





CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page


### Power of Observation
Starting at 14th level, you may unlock any one "Rare" or lower Color of Observation Haki Advancement feat from Chapter 7. If you have already taken all the rare and lower observation haki feats, you may take a rare or lower haki advancement feat under a different color of haki, assuming you meet the prerequisites.

### Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


## Roguish Archetypes

There are various types of rogues that utilize a number of different tools to steal from their targets in the shadows, attack with elemental tricks, or duel in close range using fancy maneuvers. Through developing these methods of combat, several archetypes have emerged.

### Swashbuckler

You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Duelists and pirates typically belong to this archetype.

#### Fancy Footwork
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

#### Rakish Audacity
Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

```
```



#### Panache
At 9th level, your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling. As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) check contested by a creature's Wisdom (Insight) check. The creature must be able to hear you, and the two of you must share a language.

If you succeed on the check and the creature is hostile to you, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you and can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until one of your companions attacks the target or affects it with a spell, or until you and the target are more than 60 feet apart.

If you succeed on the check and the creature isn't hostile to you, it is charmed by you for 1 minute. While charmed, it regards you as a friendly acquaintance. This effect ends immediately if you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

#### Elegant Maneuver
Starting at 13th level, you can use a bonus action on your turn to gain advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check you make during the same turn.

#### Master Duelist
Beginning at 17th level, your mastery of the blade lets you turn failure into success in combat. If you miss with an attack roll, you can roll it again with advantage. Once you do so, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.


  



CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

### Thief
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

#### Fast Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

#### Second-Story Work
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

#### Supreme Sneak
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

#### Use Special Gadgets
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of technology that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of special gadgets (magic items).

#### Thief's Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.



  






### Elemental Trickster

Elemental Tricksters have mastered the science of many complex traps, tools, and plants. They may use these tools to aid in combat or simply create a number of illusory effects to distract your opponent.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this archetype at 3rd Level, you gain proficiency with darts, blowguns, and giant slings.


CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

\page

#### Nature Powers (Spellcsating)
When you reach 3rd Level, you gain the ability to cast Nature Powers (Spells). See the general rules of Spellcasting and the Tinkerer spell list in chapter 8.

**Natural Abilities (Cantrips).** You learn three natural abilities (cantrips): Druidcraft and two other Cantrips of your choice from the Tinkerer spell list. You learn another tinkerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Nature Power Slots (Spell Slots).** The Elemental Trickster Nature Powers table shows how many Nature Power Slots you have to cast Tinkerer Spells of 1st Level and higher as Nature Powers. To cast one of these Nature Powers (spells)⁠, you must expend a slot of the nature power’s level or higher. You regain all expended Nature Power Slots when you finish a Long Rest. 

For example, if you know the 1st-level nature power Charm Person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level slot available, you can use charm person⁠ using either slot.

**Nature Powers (Spells) Known of 1st-Level and Higher**. You know three 1st-level Tinkerer Spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the Enchantment and Illusion spells⁠ on the tinkerer spell list.

The Natural Powers Known (Spells Known) column of the Elemental Trickster Natural Powers table shows when you learn more Tinkerer spells⁠ of 1st Level or higher. Each of these spells⁠ must be an Enchantment or Illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd Level.

The Nature Powers (Spells) you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Tinkerer Spells you know with another nature power (spell) of your choice from the tinkerer⁠ spell list. The new nature power must be of a level for which you have Nature Power Slots, and it must be an Enchantment or Illusion nature power (spell), unless you're replacing the nature power you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

**Special Power Ability**. Intelligence is your Special Power ability for your Tinkerer spells⁠, since you learn your Nature Powers (Spells) through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a nature power (spell) refers to your Special Power (spellcasting⁠) ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a tinkerer spell you cast and when making an Attack roll with one.

**Special Power save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

**Special Power Attack modifier** = your Proficiency Bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

#### Nature's Invention
Starting at 3rd Level, when you cast Druidcraft, you can perform the following additional tasks with it:

* You can make your next Ranged Weapon attack deal fire, cold, or lightning damage instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier. You regain all uses of this feature again once you complete a short or long rest.
* You can enhance any natural shell and turn it into a Simple Dial of your choice. You can't use this feature again until you complete a long rest. You can have a number of Dials created this way equal to your Intelligence Modifier. You can cast this spell again to remove the properties from a Simple Dial you created and revert it back to a normal shell.
* You create a natural trap of your choice. This works the same as a Hunting Trap or Caltrops (pick one). You can use this feature a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier. You regain all uses of this feature again once you complete a short or long rest.







#### Gift of the Wild

At 9th level, you may also learn Druid Spells using your Nature Power (Spellcasting) feature, using the same limitations.

Additionally, you may use Druidcraft as a bonus action.

#### Ingenious Ambush

Starting at 13th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you Cast a Nature Power (Spell) on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the nature power (spell) this turn.

#### Lord of Nature

At 17th level, you gain the ability to sap the power from a special power (spell) and use it by channeling it through your plants.

Immediately after a creature casts a special power (spell) that Targets you or includes you in its area of Effect, you can use your Reaction to attempt to absorb the effect into a seed and force the creature to make a saving throw with its Special Power (Spellcasting) ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the special power’s Effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the special power (spell) if it is at least 1st Level and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a Tinkerer spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the special power (spell) through your attunement with nature and can cast it using your Nature Power Slots. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

You know two Cantrips of your choice from the skald spell list. You learn additional skald Cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Natural Abilities (Cantrips) Known column of the Skald table.

The extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Versatile Verse

At 2nd level, if a creature has a Skaldic Verse die from you and casts a spirit power (spell) that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spirit power.

## Skald Schools

Skalds have many different methods of utilizing their mystical powers, primarily through the school in which teaches them. Since skaldic tales and abilities stem from their music, stories, or other performances, the type of performance can often impact what effect it has on on the people around them. More strict schools might involve a heavily disciplined and militaristic way of telling tales and playing music, while more liberal and expressive schools will allow for more beautiful and inspiring music.

### School of Hypnotism
Hypnotists specialize in using their performances to put all that experience it into a mind-altering trance. This can be used to aid their allies or manipulate their enemies in any situation. These verses and songs are known to be tranquil and soothing, but can prove harmful to enemies nonetheless.

```
```



#### Pain-Numbing Verse
When you join the School of Hypnotism at 3rd Level, you hypnotize your allies to allow them to ignore pain.

When an ally is hit with a damaging attack, you can expend one use of your Skaldic Verse die to give 2d6 Temporary Hit Points to the target of the attack.

The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th Level, 5d6 at 10th level, and 8d6 at 15th level.


#### Hypnotic Words
At 3rd Level, you learn to infuse your words with a hypnotic rythm that can alter and manipulate the minds of those that hear you.
If you speak to a Humanoid alone for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to hypnotize them. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spirit (spell) save DC or be Charmed by you or another creature of your choice. The target is Charmed in this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, threatened in any way, or until it witnesses its allies being attacked or damaged.

If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or Long Rest.

#### Collar of Command
At 6th level, you gain the ability to better control others using hypnosis. As a Bonus Action, you cast Command, without expending a spirit power slot, and you gain an authoritative aura for 1 minute or until your Concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast Command as a Bonus Action on each of your turns, without expending a spirit power slot.

Any creature Charmed by you automatically fails its saving throw against the Command you cast with this feature.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.




#### Complete Hypnosis
At 14th level, you gain the ability to completely hypnotize others with your words and tap into a creature’s psyche.

As an action, you hypnotically Whisper a phrase that only one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you can hear. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. It automatically succeeds if it doesn’t share a language with you or if it can’t hear you. On a successful saving throw, your Whisper Sounds like unintelligible mumbling and has no Effect.

On a failed saving throw, the target is Charmed by you for the next 8 hours or until you or your allies Attack it, damage it, or force it to make a saving throw. It is hypnotized and will listen to anything you say with an open mind.

The Charmed creature obeys your commands as if you were a close friend. It won’t risk its life for you or fight for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.

When the Effect ends, the creature has no understanding of what happened during its trance and will remember it all as a foggy dream.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.





CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### School of Battlehymn
Any Skald who enters or learns from the school of battlehymn becomes a powerful warrior that uses phrases, words, and song to amplify their power in battle along with their allies. Music and verses produced from these skalds are often serious and triumphant in nature, giving those who hear it the will to continue fighting fiercely.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the School of Battlehymn at 3rd Level, you gain proficiency with Medium Armor, Shields, and Martial Weapons.

#### Warrior Verse
Also at 3rd Level, you learn to inspire others in battle. A creature that has a Skaldic Verse die from you can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made. Alternatively, when an Attack roll is made against the creature, it can use its Reaction to roll the Skaldic Verse die and add the number rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll but before knowing whether it hits or misses.

#### Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can Attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on Your Turn.

#### War Rythm
At 14th level, you have mastered the art of Spirit Power and weapon use into a single harmonious act. When you use your action to cast a skald spirit power (spell), you can make one weapon Attack as a Bonus Action.





### School of the Underworld
Despite its scary title, this school often teaches techniques that empowers an individual's soul through majestic or otherworldly verses and melodies connected to the Underworld. Witnessing a performance from this type of skald can be equally beautiful and haunting. It is said that reciting these verses will leave all who hear it doomed to an eternity in the underworld after death.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the School of the Underworld at 3rd Level, you gain proficiency with three Skills of your choice.

#### Haunting Verse
Also at 3rd Level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an Attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your Reaction to expend one of your uses of Skaldic Verse, rolling a Skaldic Verse die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the Attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being Charmed.

```
```



#### Additional Tale of Legends
At 6th level, you have heard the whispers of the underworld which tell of forbidden abilities and secrets used by ancient legends. You learn two Spells of your choice from any Class (from standard 5e). A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Skald table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells⁠ count as skald spirit powers⁠ for you but don’t count against the number of skald spirit powers⁠ you know

#### Power of the Deep
Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Skaldic Verse. Roll a Skaldic Verse die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.

CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

### Class Features
As a Tinkerer, you gain the following Class Features.

#### Hit Points

**Hit Dice**: 1d6 per Tinkerer level

**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier

**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per Tinkerer level after 1st

#### Proficiencies

**Armor:** None

**Weapons:** Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, muskets

**Tools:** Thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools, one type of artisan’s tools of your choice

**Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom

**Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion

#### Equipment
You start with the following Equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:

* (a) a Quarterstaff or (b) a Dagger
* a gadget of choice and blueprints
* thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack

### Creation Power (Spellcasting)
As a Student of robotics and advanced technology⁠, you have Gadget of choice along with blueprints containing Creations (spells) that show the first glimmerings of your true abilities. This class uses the Tinkerer Spell List in Chapter 8.

#### Gadget & Blueprints (Spellbook)
At 1st Level, you have a Gadget and blueprints (similar to a spellbook in standard 5e) containing six 1st-level Tinkerer Spells of your choice. Your Blueprints⁠ are instructions which tell you how to build your gadget, as well as a Repository of the spells and abilities⁠ you discover, except your natural abilities (Cantrips), which can be used with or without your blueprints and gadget using materials or separate devices and methods. Your gadget is a form of Power Source (in Chapter 5 under "Adventuring Gear"), and is used as a spellcasting focus.

#### Tools Required
To build, add to, and use your gadget, which allows you to cast your tinkerer Creation Power (spell) Effects, you must use special tools—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way.


#### Natural Abilities (Cantrips)

At 1st Level, you know three Natural Abilities (Cantrips) of your choice from the Tinkerer spell list. You learn additional Tinkerer Cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Natural Abilities (Cantrips) Known column of the Tinkerer table.

```
```



#### Preparing and Using Creations (Casting Spells)
The Tinkerer table shows how many Creation Power (Spell) Slots you have to cast your Spells of 1st Level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

You prepare and install the list of Tinkerer Creation Powers (Spells) onto your gadget that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of spells⁠ from your Blueprints equal to your Intelligence modifier + your Tinkerer level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots.

For example, if you’re a 3rd-level Tinkerer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level Creation Power (Spell) Slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared Spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd Level, in any combination, chosen from your Blueprints. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠.

You can change your list of prepared Creation Powers (Spells) installed on your gadget when you finish a Long Rest. Preparing a new list of Creation Powers⁠ requires time spent studying your Blueprints and adding them to parts of your gadget using your tools: at least 1 minute per Creation Power (Spell) Level for each creation power (spell) on your list.

#### Creation Power Ability (Spellcasting Ability)
Intelligence is your Creation (Spellcasting) ability for your Tinkerer Creation Powers (Spells), since you learn your spells⁠ through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a Tinkerer Creation Power (spell) you cast and when making an Attack roll with one.

**Creation save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

**Creation Attack modifier** = your Proficiency Bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

#### Your Blueprints
The Creation Powers (Spells) and abilities that you add to your Gadget from Blueprints as you gain levels reflect the advanced Research you conduct on your own, as well as scientific breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the world and technological innovation. You might find other spells⁠ during your Adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on blueprints in an abandoned factory, for example, or in dusty records in an ancient library⁠.

**Copying a Creation Power (Spell) into your Blueprints⁠**. When you find a Tinkerer Creation Power (Tinkerer spell) of 1st Level or higher, you can add it to your Blueprints if it is of a Creation Power (Spell) Level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.




CHAPTER 3 | CLASSES

Copying that creation into your Blueprints involves reproducing the basic form of the creation, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the Inventor who designed it. You must practice the creation power until you understand the technology, methods, and parts required, then transcribe it into your Blueprints⁠ using your own notation.

For each level of the creation power (spell), the process takes 2 hours and costs ฿500,000. The cost represents material Components you expend with the writing utensils you need to record it, as well as the tools and supplies used as you experiment with the creation power (spell) and add new parts to your gadget to power the ability. 

**Replacing your Blueprints or Gadget⁠**. You can copy a creation power (spell) from your own blueprints to another blueprint—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your blueprints to craft another device⁠. This is just like copying a creation (spell) into your blueprints⁠, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and ฿100,000 for each level of the copied creation (spell) to copy the blueprints.

If you lose your blueprints, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Creation Powers (Spells) that you have prepared into new blueprints⁠. Drawing out the remainder of your blueprints requires you to find new creations (spells)⁠ to do so, as normal. For this reason, many tinkerers keep backup blueprints in a safe place. 

Rebuilding your gadget requires having your tools. You must spend at least 1 hour rebuilding your gadget using your tools during a Short or Long Rest in order to use it again. If you are missing your tools, you can choose to pay for a new Power Source instead, which will serve as your new gadget.

**The Gadget's Appearance.** Your specialized Gadget is a unique device that you build and add to over time, with its own decorative features and designs. It might be a plain metallic staff that can be disassembled, an attached segment of a weapon you are proficient with, or a complex contraption with interconnecting parts and robotic protrusions.

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a Tinkerer creation power (spell) as a ritual if that creation power has the ritual tag and you have the creation power in your Blueprints. You don’t need to have the creation power prepared.

#### Learning Creation Powers (Spells) of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a Tinkerer level, you can add two Tinkerer Spells of your choice to your Blueprint (Spellbook) for free. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have Creation Power (Spell) Slots, as shown on the Tinkerer table. On your Adventures, you might find other Creation Powers (Spells) that you can add to your Blueprints and Gadget.

```
```



### Recharging
You have learned how to restore bits of power to your Gadget by recharging it during a rest. Once per day when you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended Creation Power (Spell) Slots to recover. The Creation Power Slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Tinkerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-level Tinkerer, you can recover up to two levels worth of Spell Slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level Spell Slots.

### Tinkerer Study
When you reach 2nd Level, you choose your study, shaping your knowledge and practice of inventing through various schools: Military Science, Meteorology, and Robotics.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd Level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Adaptive Cantrip Technology

At 3rd level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one tinkerer cantrip you know with another cantrip from the tinkerer spell list.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th Level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two Ability Scores of your choice by 1. Alternatively, you can take a feat listed in **Chapter 6**. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Master of Innovation
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain Creation Powers (Spells) that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level Tinkerer Creation Power (spell) and a 2nd-level Tinkerer spell that are in your Spellbook. You can cast those spells⁠ at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the Spells you chose for different spells⁠ of the same levels.

### Ultimate Technology
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful Creation Powers (Spells) and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level Tinkerer creation powers in your spellbook⁠ as your signature creation powers⁠. You always have these creation powers⁠ prepared, they don’t count against the number of creation powers you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd Level without expending a creation power (spell) slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or Long Rest.

If you want to cast either creation power at a higher level, you must expend a creation power slot as normal.

## Tinkerer Studies

Tinkerers all love to pursue scientific innovation and developing new inventions, but many specialize in different fields depending on their profession. Different types of studies will produce different results for the technology created. The personality, profession, and goals of your tinkerer may affect what studies they utilize.

### Military Science
Those who study military science are heavily trained in using their knowledge and abilities for war or battle. It enhances a tinkerer's offensive and defensive capabilities in battle, making them primarily versatile in fights.




#### Deflector Shield
At 2nd Level, you have learned to create technology that fortifies yourself against harm. When you are hit by an Attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your Reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that Attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.

When you use this feature, you can’t cast Creation Powers (Spells) other than Natural Abilities (Cantrips) until the end of your next turn.

#### Tactical Mind
Starting at 2nd Level, your quick wit and tactical thinking allows you to react fast in battle. You gain a bonus to your Initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.

#### Power Surge
Starting at 6th level, you can store power and energy within your gadgets to later empower your damaging Creation Powers (Spells). In its stored form, this energy is called a Power Surge.

You can store a maximum number of Power Surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a Long Rest, your number of Power Surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a creation power (spell) with Dispel Magic or Counterspell, you gain one Power Surge, as you steal energy from the special power (spell) you foiled. If you end a Short Rest with no Power Surges, you gain one Power Surge.

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a Tinkerer creation power (spell), you can spend one Power Surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals your Tinkerer level.

#### Durable Tech
Beginning at 10th level, your technology is made to be incredibly tough and difficult to disrupt. While you maintain Concentration on a spell, you have a +2 bonus to AC and all Saving Throws.

#### Deflecting Shroud
At 14th level, your Deflector Shield becomes infused with deadly energy. When you use your Deflector Shield feature, you can cause power to arc from you. Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you each take force damage equal to half your Tinkerer level.

### Meteorology
Those who study meteorology and weather science are often known for designing a numerous machines and tools that allow them to manipulate weather and storms. Some hail from places such as Weatheria, and some may simply develop these technologies on their own.

#### Cloud Surfing
Starting at 2nd level, you can use a Bonus Action on Your Turn to create a floating cloud beneath you that that pulls you in any direction using an air current, immediately before or after you Cast a Creation Power (Spell) of 1st level or higher. Doing so allows you to fly up to 10 feet without provoking Opportunity Attacks.




#### Storm Forecasting
At 6th level, you gain Resistance to lightning and thunder damage while holding your gadget. In addition, whenever you start Casting a Creation Power (Spell) of 1st level or higher that deals lightning or thunder damage, storm clouds emerge from your gadget. This eruption causes creatures of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of you to take lightning or thunder damage (choose each time this ability activates) equal to half your Tinkerer level.

At 18th level, you become immune to lightning and thunder damage while holding your gadget.

#### Weather Control
At 10th level, you gain the ability to create and control weather around you.

If it is raining, you can use an action to cause the rain to stop Falling or wind to change direction in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on you. You can end this Effect as a Bonus Action. 

As an action, you can cause clouds to form in a 20-foot-radius Sphere around you and create rain and wind in that area for 1 minute. Up to 10 gallons of water will fall from this rain altogether onto whatever surface is beneath it, extinguishing any small flames, and reducing all fire damage dealt in the area by an amount equal to your intelligence modifier. The wind will disperse any fog within 20 feet of you while this Effect is active. You can also end this Effect as a Bonus Action. You can use this effect a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus until you complete a Long Rest. If you are out of uses of this feature, you may expend a creation power (spell) slot to use it again.

#### Thunder Counter
Starting at 14th level, when you are hit by a melee Attack, you can use your Reaction to deal thunder damage to the attacker. The damage equals your Tinkerer level. The attacker must also make a Strength saving throw against your Tinkerer creation (spell) save DC. On a failed save, the attacker is pushed in a straight line up to 20 feet away from you.

### Robotics

Those who study robotics love to design automatons and robotic constructs or devices. These types of tinkerers can craft robots and mobile devices that aid them in simples tasks or combat.

#### Machine Summoning
Starting at 2nd Level, whenever you summon a creature using a Conjuration Creation Power (spell), it will appear as a machine or robot that you crafted. It will also be considered a Construct, but retain all other properties. The money and time you must spend to copy a Conjuration creation power into Your Gadget is halved.

#### Simple Robots
At 2nd Level, you can use your action to quickly craft a short robot in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of you. This robot counts as a tiny or small Construct and weighs no more than 10 pounds, and it can only be made of simple materials and metals. Its AC is equal to 8 + your Intelligence Modifier, and its HP is 1. It can function and move within 30 feet of you while you hold your Gadget. Once it leaves this radius, it will power down and become useless. It can walk, swim, or fly (pick one) at a speed of 30 feet while it is active, and carry up to half of its weight. As an action on your turn, you can tell it to perform a simple task such as retrieving an object nearby, opening a small door, or fitting through a tight space. 

Additionally, you can instead create an inanimate contraption in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see within 5 feet of you. This object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10 pounds, and its shape must be that of a simple object that you have seen. The object is electrically powered, radiating bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet if you use a bonus action to turn it on.

This robot or contraption falls apart and gets destroyed after 1 hour unless you spend an action to maintain it at the end of the hour. It will also be destroyed if it takes at least a point of damage, or if you make another robot or contraption.

#### Quantum Teleportation
Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport⁠ up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can choose a space within range that is occupied by a robot, contraption, or Construct that you have created or summoned. You both teleport, swapping places.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest or you cast a Conjuration creation power (spell) of 1st level or higher.

#### Autopilot Controls
Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a Conjuration creation power (spell), your Concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.

#### Reinforced Exterior
Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a Conjuration creation power (spell) has 30 Temporary Hit Points.

If you want to rely more on incorporating guns or other ranged weapons into your build, dexterity would also be your priority. 

#### Quick Build

You can make a Warrior quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on Melee Weapons or on guns (or Finesse weapons).

### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd Level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On Your Turn, you can take one additional action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Warrior Type

## Warrior Types

Fighters can vary by the types of weapons they use, what style of fighting they want to utilize, and what they want to provide for their allies. Once you have chosen the type of warrior you are, follow the subclass features listed below.

### Cursed Soul

Somehow, along the lines you have become the host to one or more evil presences caged within you. This may either be due to wielding a cursed weapon, being hexed, or perhaps simply having a tainted spirit yourself. Regardless of how you became this way, you have slowly developed a craving for blood and violence. Will you follow the path of destruction? Or will you simply crumble from the curse brought upon you? Only your own strength and willpower can determine your fate.

#### Champion of Malice

When you reach 3rd Level, you harbor evil energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Cursed Spirit dice, which are each a d6. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your Proficiency Bonus, and they fuel various cursed powers you have, which are detailed below.

Some of your powers expend the Cursed Spirit die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Cursed Spirit dice when you finish a Long Rest. In addition, as a Bonus Action, you can regain one expended Cursed Spirit die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or Long Rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Cursed Spirit dice increases: at 5th Level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

**Saving Throws.** Some of your cursed abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist the curse’s Effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

**Curse save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

The powers below use your Cursed Spirit dice:

##### Demon Strike 

You can enhance your Weapons with demonic energy. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you with an Attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Cursed Spirit die, rolling it and dealing necrotic, psychic or radiant damage (your choice) to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.

##### Hellish Glare 

By channeling your curse through your appearance, you can cripple a creature that can see you within 30 feet with fear. As a bonus action on your turn, you can force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Curse save DC. If the save fails, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. Once you take this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or Long Rest, unless you expend a Cursed Spirit die to take it again.

```
```



##### Arms of Asura

You begin to grow illusory cursed arms, allowing you to make additional attacks on your turn.

When you hit a creature with an Attack, you can expend one Cursed Spirit die to attempt to damage another creature with a mirrored version of the same Attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within 30 feet of you. If the original Attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes necrotic, psychic or radiant damage (your choice) equal to the number you roll on your Cursed Spirit die.

#### Evil's Embrace
Starting at 7th level, you gain new ways to utilize your cursed spirit:

##### Fallen Angel Wings
As a Bonus Action, you grow spiritual black wings. You gain a flying speed equal to twice your walking speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this Bonus Action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or Long Rest, unless you expend a Cursed Spirit die to take it again.

##### Purgatory Strike
When you deal damage to a target with your Demon Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw. If the save fails, you can knock the target prone or move it up to 10 feet in any direction horizontally.

#### Shepard of Spirits
Beginning at 10th level, your ability to host and contain spirits has allowed your mind to grow stronger. You have Resistance to psychic damage. Moreover, if you start Your Turn Charmed or Frightened, you can expend a Cursed Spirit die and end every Effect on yourself subjecting you to those Conditions.

#### Silver Mist
Starting at 15th level, you can enhance yourself with an intense demonic aura which allows you to manifest spirital arms and weapons for a period of time. As a Bonus Action, you grow extra arms that give you advantage on one of your attacks made each turn and gain a bonus of +2 to Armor Class. This lasts for 1 minute or until you're Incapacitated.

Once you take this Bonus Action, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest, unless you expend 2 Cursed Spirit die to take it again.

#### Jest of the Dead

Beginning at 18th level, your Silver Mist feature is now enhanced even further. While using Silver Mist, you grow even more extra appendages and heads that give you these additional bonuses: 
* When you hit a creature with an Attack, you can use your Reaction to force that creature to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone, as if struck by several attacks at once.
* Additionally, your extra heads give you advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned or knocked unconcious.
* You can use your Demon Strike feature on any attack you make against a creature within 30 feet, instead of once per turn, by expending a Cursed Spirit die.

### Black Weapon
Black weapon users are born with incredibly powerful spirits and willpower, which they channel into their weapons. By utilizing armament haki, their weapons become darkened over time until they turn pitch black. 

#### Sharpened Spirit
Beginning when you choose this style at 3rd Level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

#### Haki Weapon
At 7th level, you may unlock any one "Uncommon" Color of Armament Haki Advancement feat from Chapter 7 of this book. If you have already taken all the uncommon armament haki feats, you may take an uncommon haki advancement feat under a different color of haki, assuming you meet the prerequisites.

#### Improved Style
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class feature.

#### Superior Sharpened Spirit
Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

#### Haki Weapon Master
At 18th level, you may unlock any one "Very Rare" or lower Color of Armament Haki Advancement feat from Chapter 7. If you have already taken all the very rare and lower armament haki feats, you may take a very rare or lower haki advancement feat under a different color of haki, assuming you meet the prerequisites.

### Elemental Weapon
Through learning how to channel elemental energy through your weapon, you can coat your attacks in an element of your choice. Many Wano Kuni samurai have mastered this style.

#### Elementalist (Spellcasting)
When you reach 3rd Level, you augment your martial Prowess with the ability to use Elemental Powers (Cast Spells). See "Casting a Spell" for the general rules of Spellcasting in the Standard D&D 5th Edition Player's Handbook. You use the Tinkerer spell list in Chapter 8.

**Natural Abilities (Cantrips).** You learn two Natural Abilities (Cantrips) of your choice from the Tinkerer spell list. You learn an additional tinkerer⁠ cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Elemental Power (Spell) Slots.** The Elemental Weapon Powers (Spellcasting) table shows how many Spell Slots you have to cast your tinkerer Spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended Spell Slots when you finish a Long Rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield⁠ using either slot.

**Elemental Powers (Spells)⁠ Known of 1st-Level and Higher**. You know three 1st-level Tinkerer Spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the Abjuration and Evocation spells⁠ on the Tinkerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Elemental Weapon Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Tinkerer spells⁠ of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells⁠ must be an Abjuration or Evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd Level.

The Spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the Tinkerer spells⁠ you know with another spell of your choice from the Tinkerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots, and it must be an Abjuration or Evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

**Special Power (Spellcasting) Ability**. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for your Tinkerer spells⁠, since you learn your spells⁠ through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a Tinkerer spell you cast and when Making an Attack roll with one.

**Special Power save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

**Special Power Attack modifier** = your Proficiency Bonus +
your Intelligence modifier

#### Elemental Style

At 3rd Level, you learn a ritual that creates a spiritual bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.

Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can use any bonded weapon as a Spellcasting Focus for your Tinkerer Spells. Any spells you cast will emanate from your weapon as if channeling your spirit through your weapon and releasing the spell from it. For example, if you cast Fire Bolt, imagine a fire slash or wave being released from your weapon toward your target.

Additionally, when you attack and hit with a bonded weapon, you can expend one spell slot to deal fire, cold, or lightning damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each Spell Level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d6.

You can have up to three bonded Weapons. If you attempt to bond with a fourth weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other three.

#### Dance of Elements
Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip, you can make one weapon Attack as a Bonus Action.

#### Water Siphon
At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s Resistance to your Spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon Attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

#### Lightning Dash
At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport⁠ up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport⁠ before or after the additional action.

#### Improved Dance of Elements 
Starting at 18th level, when you use your action to Cast a Spell, you can make one weapon Attack as a Bonus Action.

# Chapter 4: Crew & Background

The personality, characteristics, roles, and background of your character should have a great deal of thought and consideration put into them. How you develop these depends on how you want to play your character and how you want to fit into the world your DM is designing. Additionally, you should consider how your character will impact the roles and relationships between the other player characters and you. Although you should prioritize making a character that satisfies what you want out of a game, make sure you are allowing others to have fun alongside you when you design your character's personality and goals.

For the most part, you want to look at *Chapter 4: Personality and Background* in the **D&D 5th Edition Players Handbook** for more information on developing your character's personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. It will also provide a great number of character personality traits, alignment, and other useful info for designing your One Piece character for you to use. In addition to these, I will be providing new backgrounds and crew roles that are more utile for a One Piece setting and campaign.

## Name and Physical Characteristics

While One Piece has a wide variety of names and designs it borrows from various real people, places, and languages. 

### Name
It is difficult to categorize or simplify the naming process of One Piece in any significant way. If you wish to name your characters in the traditional One Piece manner, feel free to use the Japanese naming format with slight alterations and inspiration from other regions for your characters.

For example, if you are a Fish-man Martial Artist Cook, you might name yourself Judan (which is Japanese for 10th Dan in Karate) or something similar. And your family name might be Maguro (Japanese for Bluefin Tuna). So your full name might be Maguro Judan. Alternatively, you could implement more western style names into your character's name or nickname. Since this example character is also a cook, you could consider swapping the first or last name with Marzipan, a western confection. This method will help you give your character a more One Piece inspired name for any campaign. However, it is ultimately up to how you want to come up with your character's name.

### Physical Appearance

One Piece displays a wide variety of character designs and styles throughout its story. Many character designs appear cartoonish, while others may appear to resemble real life leaders or historical figures. 

If you want to emulate the style of traditional One Piece characters, especially those found on the Grand Line, be sure to exaggerate a lot of your character's features and habits. If you want to design a character that is a baseball player, you might give him large hands and a huge baseball cap. Or if you want to design a tall and slender marksman, you could make her roughly 8 feet tall and carry an extremely long rifle on her back.

Most player characters should be around small or medium in size, meaning they will be anywhere from 2 to 8 feet tall (unless altered by a special effect or devil fruit). Any character shorter or taller than this would be a different character size, such as Large or Tiny. Most humans will be somewhere around 5 to 6 feet tall, while other races will vary greatly in size. 

If you are unsure, you can randomize your height and weight using the D&D 5e Players Handbook method by using [4'8" + 2d10] to determine your character's height, and use [110 lb. x (2d4) lb.] to determine your character's weight.

### Alignment

Alignment, as described in D&D, is used to describe your character's moral and personal attitude. According to the alignment system, your character's morality can be defined as **good, evil, or neutral**, and your character's personal attitude toward society and order can be identified as **lawful, chaotic, or neutral**. You combine your character's morality and personal attitude together to form your alignment. There are a total of 9 possible alignments, as follows:

* **Lawful Good (LG)** characters typically follow any laws and expectations, such as those laid out by society or any government system, while also trying their best to do the right thing. Many upstanding Marines and citizens may fall under this category. (e.g. Koby)
* **Neutral Good (NG)** creatures do their best to help others, but only while following their own path and satisfying their own desires. Independent Marines, citizens, and certain kind-hearted adventurers may fall under this category. (e.g. Smoker)
* **Chaotic Good (CG)** individuals act on impulse and a more instinctual desire to help others, while rarely following the status quo and common expectations. Certain pirates and explorers with hearts of gold will fall under this alignment. (e.g. Luffy)
* **Lawful Neutral (LN)** characters will follow all laws and personal codes they believe in, but are far less concerned about how positively or negatively they impact others. Most marines fall under this category. (e.g. Kizaru)
* **Neutral (N)** is an alignment of folk who avoid taking any side or moral stance on issues, doing whatever seems naturally best for them in each situation. Many independent pirates and lone wolf figures fall under this alignment. (e.g. Mihawk)


CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

* **Chaotic Neutral (CN)** individuals prioritize absolute freedom, and do whatever their gut tells them to do, even if it isnt beneficial for others. Many pirates and revolutionaries may fall under this alignment. (e.g. Ace)


* **Lawful Evil (LE)** creatures are willing to take from others and commit horrible deeds, so long as they follow a set of rules, traditions, and order. Very cruel marines may fall under this alignment. (e.g. Akainu)
* **Neutral Evil (NE)** characters are selfish, often twisted, and frequently prioritize their own interests and goals over the happiness of anyone else. Evil pirates seeking fortune and power may fall under this alignment. (e.g. Blackbeard)


* **Chaotic Evil (CE)** creatures are cruel, greedy, hateful, and bloodthirsty, always seeking out prey and creatures to harm. The most despicable pirates and criminals fall under this alignment. (e.g. Doflamingo)

## Personal Characteristics

Your character's characteristics make up their personality and relationships with others and the world around them. These characteristics include personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws.

Each background will include a number of examples of each personal characteristic for you to use or roll up.

### Personality Traits
Your character should have about two personality traits that are often acted out. These personality traits should be fun and interesting to act out for you while roleplaying as your character. They will also set apart your character from others, and could make you a memorable part of the group.

These traits might include something your character appreciates, funny quirks, mannerisms, past accomplishments, strange ways of laughing or talking, or a reflection of his or her ability scores.

### Ideals
Choose one ideal for your character. Ideals are powerful motivators that brings your character a great deal of joy or satisfaction through exploring or progressing through the campaign. These may include the dreams, morals, ethics, beliefs, and goals of your character. These ideals should be expressed by your character whenever necessary, through action or words. For example, if your character believes him or herself to be a hero that saves others across the sea, you might always try to respond to cries for help and convince your allies to assist you.

Consider using elements of your race, class, role, and background to decide what ideals will drive you throughout the adventure.

### Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds can be described as a connection your character has with a person, place, group, or thing. This bond can impact parts of your personality traits, ideal, and flaws in various ways. 

Some examples of bonds can be a deep connection to a person who once existed in your life that you learned a lot from. Or perhaps a place you grew up in was taken over by marines, and you wish to return there some day. Maybe you carry a ring or bracelet that holds a ton of sentimental value. No matter what your bond may be, it should be a powerful factor in how your character makes decisions or develops his or her goals.

Consider using elements of your race, class, role, and background to decide what bonds you may have with other people, places, or things.


### Flaws
Lastly, choose a flaw for your character. A flaw is something that is normally considered a weakness or negative trait your character might have. It could be a quality that is fun to act out, or it could serve to balance your character's overwhelmingly positive traits. This could be an irrational fear, weakness, embarrassing secret, compulsion, or negative bias against something most regard as positive.

Consider using elements of your race, class, role, and background to determine what might be a weakness or fear of your character.

## Inspiration Dice Alternative: Pirate Prestige

In order to understand how crew roles work, it is important to understand a new system of reward points I am introducing called "*Pirate Prestige*". This is intended to reward players for playing their roles to the best of their ability, while also promoting proper teamwork. A crew that works together will succeed, and this system is designed to make that process feel very fulfilling. While you can use Inspiration Dice in favor of this system if you don't like it, it is another easy way to balance crew roles by rewarding points to players, which can be used for strengthening their role's abilities and different roleplay elements.

The way this works is fairly simple. Whenever players overcome a difficult challenge, like winning a fight against a mighty enemy pirate, battling a deadly storm on the seas, or simply saving a town from danger, everyone who did well in that situation will gain a point of pirate prestige. However, characters that were absent, didn't want to help the group, or simply complained and caused issues for others shouldn't receive any points. Fighting pointless battles, intentionally running into dangerous situations which have no reward, or simply trying to farm these points will not net the crew any points. At higher levels, you can also choose to elect an MVP character during an event. Players may decide someone in the crew went above and beyond in overcoming a challenge, and give them a large surge of pirate prestige points at the end of the encounter. An MVP may roll a 1d4 at the end of such an event, and gain a number of pirate prestige points equal to the number rolled. A character can have a maximum number of Pirate Prestige points equal to half their character level, rounded up.


CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

### Methods of Spending Pirate Prestige
While pirate prestige should be primarily used to benefit the crew as a whole and should heavily reward teamwork, it can also be spent in a few other ways. Stockpiling these points can be rewarding and beneficial to overcoming future challenges. Other uses for pirate prestige is described under "Crew Roles" up next, but these points can be used for anything that the DM deems to be fun or appropriate for roleplay, investigating, or exploration, such as the following abilities:

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Locate Quests
When exploring a populated town, city, or village, a character may expend 1 pirate prestige point to locate a random NPC or troubled creature that will provide them with a task to complete (up to the DM to decide the difficulty and reward), without needing to make any skill checks. To use this ability again, a character must complete a long rest.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Find Minor Clue
If a group is stuck on a mission or quest that they need to complete, a character may expend 1 pirate prestige point to ask the DM for a minor hint or clue that may lead them on the right track. This can only be used once per character during any single mission or quest.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Gain Reputation
If a group wants to gain recognition or respect in a single kingdom, village or town, or simply undo their negative reputation, characters may spend 24 hours and 1 pirate prestige point to spread rumors and tales of their deeds and gain 1 point of reputation in that location (explained further in the One Piece D&D 5E DM's guide). A character can only use this ability this way once per location, and a crew can only spend a total of 5 pirate prestige points altogether to gain reputation in a location. A crew cannot use this ability when they only have 1 reputation point in that location.

## Crew Roles

Your crew role is an additional feature that can be used alongside your character's background and class. It essentially gives you the ability to specialize in a field or duty and succeed where others may fail. While it may not provide a wide variety of bonuses and stats, it will be crucial to developing a stable crew and allocating jobs on a functioning ship. Your role should be something you enjoy doing when playing as your character. For example, if you are a cyborg tinkerer, you may take pride in being the crew's shipwright. This may also tie into your character's ideals and background.

Deciding your role can depend on your class and background, but can ultimately be anything that would fit your character's interests. Work with other players to decide what would make for a balanced team, and try to give everyone a unique position and function. Without proper coordination and cohesion, as well as leadership, a ship and its crew could easily fall apart. While your role may not provide any proficiencies, equipment, or languages, it will provide features that will make you a very useful and unique addition to your crew.

Crew role can be decided at any point early in the campaign or during character introductions. But it should make sense and align with everyone character's strengths and abilities.

#### Allocating or Swapping Roles

While a crew role can be decided at any point when designing or playing your character early on, it may prove difficult to suddenly change roles on a whim. While you can officially swap to a different role and perform its basic functions, you cannot have the pirate prestige abilities of a new role until you actively work and study that role for at least [3d6 x 10] days to adjust to it. Until then, can only perform basic tasks for that role and use the regular features.


  



CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

### Captain

Your role is very simple: you motivate, guide, and command your ship and crew. It is possible for the captain of a ship to have a number of complex roles, but they should typically be the strongest and most charismatic individual in a crew. Some captains may differ or have unique personalities, but their goal should be to unite their allies in troubling times to tackle any obstacle, in order to accomplish their dreams and goals.

The captain should always have the last say during any group decision or plan. While some crews may not entirely center around their captain, it is important to still give them a high degree of authority over the decision process.

#### Feature: Captain's Charisma
A captain is the head of the ship, but should never act like a tyrant when operating a healthy crew. When they lead a charge, your allies should follow. When they call a shot, others should respect it. When they are speaking, the crew should listen. This shouldn't be a power that is abused, but rather a quality that your comrades revere. If you tell a member of your crew to perform an action, they will feel naturally compelled to complete it. However, if a duty directly goes against their alignment, ideals, personality traits, class, background, or race (or is simply too ridiculous to consider), they are allowed to refrain.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Crew Recruitment
*To understand how to run crew recruitment, make sure the DM has read information on "Hirelings" under the Ships and Sailing section in the [Dungeons and Devil Fruits Dungeon Master's Guide](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/sK-UDzk7x8U_).

A character that has the captain role can easily recruit other pirates by spending their pirate prestige points at various locations. A captain can spend a pirate prestige point to recruit a regular hireling or specialist for a week without needing to pay them. The hireling will still need to have their basic needs met, and will demand pay a week after the initial week is over unless another prestige point is spent.

You cannot recruit in locations where your crew has a reputation of 5 or less. 


  



CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page





### Navigator

The role of a navigator involves charting, mapping, and understanding the weather and conditions that they may encounter on their crew's journey. The navigator is crucial to the ship effectively progressing to the next island or continent throughout the adventure. Without a decent navigator on board, the crew may end up lost for several days or weeks in dangerous waters.

Being a navigator means you must take responsibility for charting the crew's course, making rolls to stay on course, and avoiding getting lost or stuck in storms and bad weather.

#### Feature: Charting and Mapping
A player that chooses the navigator role will actively aid in helping the crew along both in and out of character. With the DM's assistance, you have the ability to physically map out and chart the course of the ship and nearby islands. Sometimes, you will be required to make various Wisdom or Intelligence skill checks to properly map out territories in more treacherous waters. Otherwise, this process should be effortless for your character under ordinary circumstances.

Additionally, you can assist in directing the ship on the right path. If the helmsman or captain is attempting to stay on course in the proper direction, you may assist them in rolling skill checks if you have properly analyzed the weather and map of the surrounding region.


#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Storm Tracking
In places like the grand line, fully understanding the weather and climate conditions is often incredibly difficult. However, that doesn't mean it's impossible for a talented navigator. In most situations, if you are about to run into dangerous weather or climates, the DM may warn the navigator in advance if they succeed on their skill checks. This may be done through subtle hints or simply describing what kind of weather is seen up ahead.

In some instances, the weather may appear so dangerous that it would cause a great deal of damage to the ship and crew if sailed through. If the navigator is unable to find a way around this, they may choose to expend 1 pirate prestige point to completely steer clear and avoid the storm or danger. It is possible that the storm may be exceptionally dangerous, so much so that 1 pirate prestige point won't be enough to satisfy the condition and completely avoiding it. In this case, the DM may demand that you spend additional points to navigate around such a situation in the more extreme regions of the world.

### Doctor

The ship's doctor is responsible for keeping track of the injuries and overall health of their crewmates and captain. They have a good understanding of medical science and procedures. They can perform surgeries, create medicine, and alleviate sickness or diseases. 

Taking on the doctor role leaves you in charge of caring for your allies when they are hurt or in need of medical assistance. Skalds and Priests in particular may excel at completing these tasks.

#### Feature: Advanced Treatment
As a doctor, you are capable of understanding and analyzing all forms of medicine and medical treatments. You are proficient in using and administering antidotes, medicine, and other medical tools. When you use a healer’s kit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains 1 hit point. Additionally, when a creature is suffering from disease, blindness, deafness, paralysis, or poison, you can spend ฿400,000 to gather the medical supplies required to treat them and end one of these conditions over the course of 1 hour.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: First Aid
When you take the doctor crew role, you are capable of stitching up wounds and providing first aid to yourself and your allies. You can spend 1 pirate prestige point as an action to restore 1d6 + 4 hit points to an injured creature, plus additional hit points equal to the creature’s maximum number of Hit Dice. The creature can’t regain hit points from this ability again until it finishes a short or long rest.


  



CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page


### Chef

The chef of the ship provides meals filled with nutrients and warmth to their crew after a long day of sailing and exploring. While this role may not be as extreme as others in every situation, it is just as vital to have. Without a chef, the crew may begin to poorly ration food, suffer from malnutrition, or grow disgusted from eating the same mundane meals. 

Chefs will provide their allies with the motivation to keep fighting, so that they can return to the ship at the end of the day and enjoy a delicious meal. Any crew will greatly appreciate their chef on board for the work they put forth in the kitchen, as food is what keeps everyone moving forward. With a good enough chef on a ship, a crew will never go hungry.

#### Feature: Food Preparation
You gain proficiency with cook’s utensils if you don’t already have it. With one hour of work or when you finish a long rest, you can cook a number of treats equal to your proficiency bonus. These special treats last 8 hours after being made. A creature can use a bonus action to eat one of those treats to gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. These treats do not count as a full meal.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: First-Class Feast
When you take the chef role, you gain the ability to focus all of your talent and effort into your dishes. As part of a short rest, you can cook special food by spending 1 pirate prestige point, provided you have ingredients and cook's utensils on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for a number of creatures equal to 4 + your proficiency bonus. At the end of the short rest, any creature who eats the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points regains an extra 1d8 hit points.


  



CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

### Shipwright
A shipwright is a wonderful role to have on board any crew that desires a powerful ship. A shipwright is in charge of building, upgrading, and repairing the ship over time. With the help of the captain and other crewmates, the shipwright may customize the ship in any way he or she sees fit. Constructing and maintaining a healthy ship will greatly aid in winning battles against other ships or simply surviving deadly storms.



#### Feature: Ship Building, Upgrading, and Repairing
Shipwrights automatically gain the ability to utilize the ship building rules in the DM section. A shipwright will be proficient in constructing a ship, and can re-roll once on any roll during the ship building process. Additionally, you will only need to pay for the parts of the ship, not the service fee during the building, upgrading, or repairing process.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Defensive Coating
When you take the Shipwright role, you gain the ability to apply an additional coating to your ship that will give it an extra layer of defense and durability. By spending any number of pirate prestige points over the course of an hour, you give the ship's hull 10 temporary hit points for every pirate prestige point spent. This coating will last 7 days or until you use this ability again, in which case the old coating will be removed and replaced with the new one.


  



CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

### Musician
A musician is the moral support and entertainment for a crew that is faced with lowered morale or increased stress. They may often serve as a crew mascot, a charismatic uniting force for their allies, or a means of gathering support from the populace. Although this role may be used primarily by the skald class, any class can take on this role.




#### Feature: Musical Talent
A musician can play any musical instrument they are proficient with to its full potential. If you aren't already proficient with an instrument, you are simply able to sing or use various inanimate objects of your choice to create wonderful music. Using song and dance to inspire your crew comes naturally and should motivate the crew to reach new heights. Upon hearing your music, others will feel energized, uplifted, and united.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Song of Legends

Performing a captivating song or play that tells of their crew's strength and legendary deeds, the musician inspires awe and admiration in locals. Using the same rules as the "Gain Reputations" Pirate Prestige ability, the musician may instead spend 1 pirate prestige point to instead raise the crew's reputation by 1d4 points in a location. This ability can only be used once per location. Additionally, this gives the party a +2 bonus to charisma checks when speaking to locals for up to 1 day after the performance takes place.


  



CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

### Lookout
A lookout is a member of a crew that is responsible for staying on the crow's nest or any other lookout point to spot any approaching ships, islands, hazards, or creatures. By using a spyglass to detect any potential dangers in the distance, a lookout will provide a crew with any necessary visual information to prepare accordingly.

#### Feature: Bird's Eye View
Lookouts are far better than others are spotting potential danger ahead. When looking from a vantage point on the ship, you are able to detect even the smallest of details through any abnormal conditions. If a location or direction is lightly obscured, such as from patchy fog or rain, you are able to treat it as if it were clear when spotting ships or islands ahead.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Sharp-Sighted Scout
When you take the lookout role, you are capable of discerning objects at extreme distances. When you make a Wisdom (Perception) check that relies on sight, you may spend 1 pirate prestige point to make the roll with advantage. Additionally, you may spend 1 pirate prestige point to gain a +5 to passive perception for 1 minute.


  



CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

### Helmsman
The helmsman is a member of a crew tasked with the role of driving and maneuvering the ship. Although the captain or navigator may sometimes take over this role, a helmsman is unmatched when driving through rough conditions or tight spots.

#### Feature: Through Thick and Thin
When steering a ship, a helmsman is a natural. Understanding water currents, when to lower or raise sails, and when to anchor is fundamental and also natural to a helmsman. When attempting to steer the ship through any obstacles or rough waters, you may add your proficiency bonus to any skill checks made, on top of any proficiencies already added, to keep the ship out of danger or avoid a specific hazard.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: At the Helm
When you take the helmsman role, you gain an affinity for moving the ship out of harm's way when under attack. When the ship or those on board are targeted by an attack or effect, you may spend 1 pirate prestige point as a reaction to add a +2 to the ship's AC and you and your allies's AC and saving throws while on the ship as it's moving, until the start of your next turn.


  




CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

### Record-Keeper
The record-keeper is responsible for keeping record of the history, journals, and events while on board the ship. The record-keeper should be fairly knowledgeable and competent when it comes to any information such as when analyzing information, pieces of island history, and artifacts.

#### Feature: Librarian of the Sea
Although being a record-keeper can involve working on a variety of different tasks and having many different goals and purposes on-board, most record-keepers is proficient in any form of note-keeping and information analysis. At the beginning of each session, the record-keeper may recap the previous session for all players to refresh their memories. 

Additionally, the record-keeper can keep note of major quests, story points, and useful information regarding the lore the DM establishes throughout the campaign. The record-keeper may also add their proficiency bonus, on top of any other proficiency bonuses, to intelligence checks when it comes to analyzing any form of writing, artifact, puzzle, or piece of history.

#### Pirate Prestige Ability: Flash of Insight
When you take the record-keeper role, you can often tap into your nearly infinite pool of knowledge and mentally archived data. By spending 1 pirate prestige point, you can discover one major clue, detail, or other piece of information about a puzzle, artifact, or form of writing. Your DM might give you a major hint or advantage on a roll to discover something vital.


  




CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

## Backgrounds
Each and every character has a history in this world. While not everyone is entirely defined by their past, many have been molded by major life events such as experiences from their upbringing, occupation, tragedies, etc. Developing a backstory is a great way to give your character more depth and motivations as they are introduced and grow throughout the campaign.

Additionally, backgrounds can contribute to a character's skills, characteristics, personality, and proficiencies. Choosing a fitting background for your character is important to understanding how they might think, feel, act, and rationalize the world around them. It will also partially shape how the world perceives them, as well as defining what knowledge and abilities they have developed prior to the adventure.

Language proficiencies will not be included in backgrounds because the One Piece world uses one universal language. Though, if the DM chooses to add additional languages, feel free to swap one of your tool proficiencies will a custom language proficiency.

#### Customizing a Background
In order to better understand how backgrounds work, feel free to check out the 5th Edition D&D Players Handbook, as it will provide additional backgrounds that you can use or modify to your liking.

If you feel as if any of these backgrounds do not fully suit your character, feel free to swap around features, choose any two skills, and take a total of two tool proficiencies from sample backgrounds. If the DM chooses to add custom languages, feel free to swap one of these tool proficiencies will a custom language proficiency.

Next, you can either use the equipment package from your background or spend Belly (฿) on gear as described in Chapter 5 (If you spend Belly this way, you can't also take the equipment package from your class). Last, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. Feel free to develop custom features with your DM if you cannot choose one that fits your character.

## Anthropologist

**Skill Proficiencies** Insight, Religion

**Tool Proficiencies** Two of your choice

**Equipment** A leather-bound diary, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, a set of traveler's clothes, one trinket of special significance, and a wallet containing ฿100,000

#### Multicultural
Before becoming an explorer or pirate, you have sought out a life among various cultures and races around the world. This may have led you to a location full of denizens of an entirely different race or culture. The folk of this place accepted you as one of their own and taught you their ways of life, enough for you to have a basic understanding of their culture, traditions, and beliefs.

Choose a race whose culture you've adopted, or roll on the Adopted Culture table.

#### Feature: Cultural Chameleon
You can begin to understand the traditions, dialects, and habits of any culture you spend enough time in. You must observe the creatures interacting with one another for at least 1 day, after which you learn a handful of important words, expressions, and gestures - enough to allow you to fit in with them on a basic level if the location isn't already hostile toward you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Anthropologists thrive in other parts of the world that are far different from the ones they were born into. They love to study and explore new cultures and beliefs developed by other races and civilizations. Many anthropologists find these new locations to satisfy their intellectual curiosity or simply develop a newfound respect for different ideas. Some may seek out fame and fortune, while others do it for more humbling reasons.

## Knight

**Skill Proficiencies** Athletics, Persuasion

**Tool Proficiencies** Your choice of a gaming set, one type of musical instrument

**Equipment** One set of traveler's clothes, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a wallet containing ฿100,000

#### Feature: Knightly Regard
Knights are defenders that fight for the inhabitants of a kingdom, following under the code of Chivalry. You have pledged allegiance to a kingdom or monarch, and ascended the ranks to earn your rank. You may have left your duties behind to go explore the world, but you are still well-respected by your kingdom and people. You receive shelter and succor from members of your kingdom and those who are sympathetic to its aims.

This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.

## Marine (or Ex-Marine)

**Skill Proficiencies** Athletics, Survival

**Tool Proficiencies** Cartographer's Tools, Vehicles (land)

**Equipment** A dagger that belonged to a fallen comrade, a folded flag emblazoned with the symbol of the marines, a set of traveler's clothes, and a wallet containing 100,000฿

#### Feature: Marching Orders
You can move twice the normal amount of time (up to 16 hours) each day before being subject to the effect of a forced march (see "Travel Pace" in chapter 8 of the D&D Player's Handbook). Additionally, you can automatically find a safe route to land a boat on shore, provided such a route exists.


CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

#### Hardship Endured
Your past as a Marine has forged you into an unstoppable living weapon. This hardship is essential to you and is at the heart of a personal philosophy or ethos that often guides your actions. It might also be the reason you potentially left the marines. You can roll on the following table to determine this hardship or choose one that best fits your character.


Hardship Endured Table



d6
Hardship




1
Mutiny. Your crew overthrew you and left you stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere.


2
Captured. You spent months enduring thirst, starvation, and torture at the hands of your enemy, but you never broke.


3
Sacrifice. You enabled the escape of your fellow soldiers, but at great cost to yourself. Some of your past comrades may think you're dead.


4
Juggernaut. No reasonable explanation can explain how you survived a particular battle. Every arrow and bolt missed you. You slew scores of enemies single-handedly and led your comrades to victory.


5
Tyranny. After exposing a corrupt high-ranking marine, you were silenced, beaten, and imprisoned for years.


6
Leave None Behind. You carried an injured marine for miles to avoid capture and death.





#### Suggested Characteristics
Marines are looked up to by many civilians and must always obey their superiors. They are veteran warriors who rarely lose composure on the battlefield. Marines who leave the service tend to work as mercenaries, but their combat experience also makes them excellent adventurers or pirates. Though they are self-reliant, marines tend to operate best in groups, valuing camaraderie and the companionship of like-minded individuals.


Marine Personality Traits

1

You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, greedy merchants, and corrupt marines who can deliver messages for you.

## Merchant

**Skill Proficiencies** Investigation, Persuasion

**Tool Proficiencies** Two types of artisan's tools

**Equipment** Two sets of artisan's tools, merchant's scale, a set of fine clothes, and a wallet containing ฿100,000

#### Feature: Supply Chain
From your time as a merchant, you retain connections with wholesalers, suppliers, and other merchants and entrepreneurs. You can call upon these connections when looking for items or information.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Being a merchant involved having a head for numbers, a strong personality, the ability to make deals with hostile adversaries, a strong sword arm to fight off bandits, and the intuition for knowing what people want and need. The art of business is the art of finding the best path to profit, and that path might be different with each transaction. It takes a strong mind and a stronger stomach to succeed. So why did you fail?


Merchant Personality Traits



d6
Personality Trait




1
I didn't have the cutthroat attitude necessary to succeed.


2
Even my competitors said I was affable and talented. Those traits should serve me well.

If I can be everyone's friend, I'll always have support.

I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more.


5
I would kill to acquire a noble title.


6
I'm horribly jealous of anyone who does my job better than me. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals.





## Noble

**Skill Proficiencies** History, Persuasion

**Tool Proficiencies** Two types of gaming sets

**Equipment** A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing ฿250,000

#### Variant Noble: Celestial Dragon (Optional)
You were born into a family of aristocrats that are descendants of nineteen of the Twenty Kings who established what is now known as the World Government. Members of the celestial dragons are rarely seen in regular society, as many solely reside inside of Mariejois. Those who leave Mariejois permanently are rarely accepted back, and may be targeted by the world government and other celestial dragons.

#### Feature: Position of Privilege
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You may not even be affiliated with your birth family anymore, but you can secure an audience with just about any noble family if you need to.


CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

#### Suggested Characteristics
Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles, to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble. Some run away from these responsibilities in order to live a more modest or adventurous lifestyle, though this is greatly frowned upon.


Noble Personality Traits



d6
Personality Trait




1
My eloquent flattery makes everyone I talk to feel like the most wonderful and important person in the world.

4
I take great pains to always look my best and follow the latest fashions.


5
I don't like to get my hands dirty, and I won't be caught dead in unsuitable accommodations.


6
Despite my noble birth, I do not place myself above other folk. We all have the same blood.






Noble Ideals



d6
Ideal




1
Respect. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. (Good)


2
Responsibility. It is my duty to respect the authority of those above me, just as those below me must respect mine. (Lawful)


3
Independence. I must prove that I can handle myself without coddling from my family. (Chaotic)


4
Power. If I can attain more power, no one will tell me what to do, including my family. (Evil)


5
Family. Blood runs thicker than water. (Any)


6
Noble Obligation. It is my duty to protect and care for the people beneath me. (Good)





```

## Pirate

**Skill Proficiencies** Athletics, Perception

**Tool Proficiencies** Navigator's tools, Carpenter's tools

**Equipment** A belaying pin (club), rope (50 feet), a lucky charm, a set of common clothes, and a wallet containing ฿100,000

#### Feature: Ship's Passage
You're an experienced pirate. When you need to, you can secure free passage on a pirate ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your DM will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Pirates can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Living as a pirate can be dangerous, but is equally rewarding in the freedom and potential wealth it offers.


Pirate Personality Traits



d6
Personality Trait




1
My friends know they can rely on me, no matter what.


2
I work hard so that I can play hard when the work is done.


3

4

5
To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.


6
I never pass up a friendly wager.






Pirate Ideals

1
Respect. The thing that keeps a ship together is mutual respect between captain and crew. (Good)


2
Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)

Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)


4
Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)


5
People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)

Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)

## Revolutionary

**Skill Proficiencies** Deception, Stealth

**Tool Proficiencies** Poisoner's kit. Disguise Kit

**Equipment** A set of common clothes, a disguise kit, a black cloak with a hood, a poisoner's kit, and a wallet containing ฿100,000

#### Variant Revolutionary: Secret Agent (Optional)

Revolutionaries have spies all over, infiltrating and deceiving various powerful organizations and government networks to bring back intelligence to the main revolutionary organization. When you take this option, with the DM's permission, you may choose to disguise yourself and deceive others into believing you have a different background for the purposes of keeping your connection to the revolutionaries a secret, or even infiltrating their group.

By creating this fake identity for yourself, you may pick another background and replace up to three proficiencies or pieces of equipment with that background. You may also develop a fake persona as a mask to match your new background, though your real personality is different. Additionally, you are able to convince everyone you meet outside of the revolutionary network that you belong to the group corresponding to that background through the way you appear and act.

```
```



#### Feature: Shadow Network
You have access to the revolutionary shadow network, which allows you to communicate with other members of the order over long distances. If you gain access to a snailphone, you may input a special sequence into it to call any revolutionary member on standby without being intercepted.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Agents of the revolutionary army are all put through intense training and taught how to infiltrate any building or organization. Although the revolutionary army's true motives are unknown to outsiders, civilians are taught to fear their influence and hold over major kingdoms or governments. Revolutionaries are often extremely secretive, and may only reveal their true identities to lifelong friends or family whom they know they can trust.

## Zealot

**Skill Proficiencies** Insight, Religion

**Tool Proficiencies** Two Artisan's Tools of your choice

**Equipment** A holy symbol, holy scripture, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and wallet containing ฿150,000

#### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
As a zealot, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your god. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material components needed. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Zealots are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.


Zealot Personality Traits

CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

## Crew Faction

An adventure through the One Piece world doesn't need to be done in any one specific fashion. The DM and the players should decide what kind of campaign they want to run in this setting, whether it be playing as pirates, marines, revolutionaries, or some other faction. One way for the DM to find what might work best for a table is to allow everyone to make their characters and see what kind of traits and backgrounds they pick.

If a party is largely composed of thieves, pirates, or other similar types of characters, it might be wise to develop the campaign into a pirate story. If a party is mostly composed of marines, knights, or honorable and law-abiding types, then a marine-centered campaign could be the best way to go. Alternatively, the DM and players could decide on or vote on what kind of campaign they want prior to making their characters. Try to be transparent with everyone at the table to find what works best. Remember, the DM should have the last say on what kind of game is being run, but never to the detriment of the entire group's fun.

Here are some examples of how some games might be run, and what the objectives could be.

### Pirate Faction Campaign

**Tool Proficiencies** Vehicles (water)

If the majority of the party is set on being pirates and following a pirate captain, a pirate campaign is a wonderful way to go. In fact, this should be the standard way of exploring and dissecting the world to eventually reach the ultimate treasure, the One Piece itself. The group may decide to elect one member of their crew, preferably the captain, as the Pirate King or Queen if they reach the end. Alternatively, the group may decide to agree on being equal and simply become a legendary crew of pirate kings and queens if they complete the campaign.

The goal of this type of adventure is to explore whatever sea is required to get across to reach the reverse mountain to get to the grand line. After that point, reaching Raftel (or Laugh Tale) should be the primary objective to secure the One Piece. You may follow the formula the Manga itself uses to reach the end, or simply have the DM come up with an alternative way of reaching the end.

Because pirates are very seldom accepted into society and most nations or towns, it may be difficult to freely explore civilized islands that aren't open to pirates. Feel free to use the reputation system found in the One Piece D&D DM's Guide to expand on how pirates are treated on each individual island. Islands that are ruled by Marine forces are naturally difficult for pirates to enter or explore without disguises. Additionally, Marines in general will chase after any pirates they encounter and try to arrest them, unless these pirates have bribed, befriended, or intimidated that specific group of Marines enough to avoid conflict or pursuit.

Revolutionaries and other factions are largely neutral toward pirates, and will only act aggressively or generous toward them on a case-by-case basis.

```
```



### Marine Faction Campaign

**Tool Proficiencies** Vehicles (water), Seastone Handcuffs

If the majority of the party is set on being marines, knights, or other lawful types of characters, a marine campaign might be the best choice for your party. This style of campaign can be run in various ways, but you should intend on following the principles of the marines (listed in ). Unlike a pirate campaign, there may be less of an adventure-oriented goal, and more of a capture/destroy or conquest goal. In this sense, hunting pirates or other rogue and anti-government factions would be the main objective.

Alternatively, if your party insists on having an adventure-driven marine campaign, the DM may decide to run it similar to the pirate style campaign, with more of a focus on seizing the One Piece and controlling Raftel to keep it away from the reach of pirates, and having the goal of capturing major pirates be worked in as a secondary objective.

Because most Marines serve their superiors in the Marines, World Government, Celestial Dragons, and Gorosei, the missions sent to you by these individuals may grant additional objectives to the party. Leveling up and completing objectives may also advance the party to a higher rank in the marines or world government, such as vice admiral, admiral, or even Cipher Pol Agent.

The reputation system can still be utilized in this style of campaign, but instead of marine-controlled islands giving you automatically low reputation, they will automatically give you high reputation. Additionally, you will start with low reputation pirate-controlled islands. Pirates who encounter Marines will always attempt to drive them away, evade them, or attack them head-on to avoid arrest.

Revolutionaries and other government-hating factions will also despise marines, potentially attacking them on sight. Nations or towns allied with the world government will normally respect and obey any marines they encounter.

### Alternative Faction Campaign

**Tool Proficiencies** Any set of Artisan's Tools or Vehicle of the party's choice

If the majority of the party refuse to make characters that align with Marine or Pirate goals, then it is possible that an entirely different faction might be best for your group to fall under. For example, if an overwhelming majority of players choose the Revolutionary background, then you might decide to run a campaign that focuses on developing and following a revolutionary path. This may involve progressing by following plans to overthrow the world government and other various governments or factions around the world.

There are a large number of factions the DM or Players may decide would work best for the group, if you'd like to use any examples from the base series.


CHAPTER 4 | CREW AND BACKGROUND

\page

## Character Dreams

To keep players invested and eagerly rushing to the table each session, especially if this is a long-running campaign, it is key to give motivation to every player and character. The most powerful motivator may come in the form of an individual character's dream. This dream could be something vague or extremely difficult to achieve. Regardless, it should be something that becomes more and more feasible to accomplish and characters advance throughout the story and grow stronger.

For example, a character may dream of creating the greatest pirate ship the world has ever seen. As the story progresses, the crew may gather more materials and wealth to upgrade the ship, slowly allowing for this character's dream to come to fruition. Accomplishing this dream toward the end of the story is important, but it is far more imperative to drive the player and character's ambition throughout the journey to build up to such a grand dream being accomplished. 

For a player to determine what their character's dream may be, it is a good idea to pull from that character's race, class, crew role, background, ideals, or bonds to develop a fitting dream. This dream should be overarching and overshadow any other less important bonds or objectives your character has. Alternatively, you may choose an option from the table below or roll to decide what your character's dream will be. You can have multiple dreams or combine them together.

# Chapter 5: Equipment

The world is filled with various shops and sellers ranging from town marketplaces to black markets. Supplies, equipment, and other goods or services may be provided in these places, allowing you to spend the money you earn throughout the campaign. In small village markets, you may be able to purchase a selection of food and simple equipment. In larger cities, you may find a larger selection of weapons, kits, gear, food, and materials. These supplies will help pirates, adventurers, and explorers prepare themselves for the open seas and any formidable islands they may encounter. In general, some rations, backpacks, rope, swords, guns, repair tools, and decent clothing and armor would be ideal purchases for any adventuring party looking to adequately prepare for their adventure.

If you manage to find a black market through the Underworld's trade network, you may be able to find extremely rare and exotic, albeit very expensive, gear and items. In some cases, this gear may include cursed weapons, devil fruits, or other dangerous items that would normally be far too risky and pricey to sell to the average buyer.

## Starting Equipment
Every character starts with a selection of equipment and adventuring gear in their inventory. When creating your character, after selecting your class and background, you may decide to start with the equipment listed in your class's starting equipment or start with a set amount of **Belly (฿)** to spend on equipment of your choice listed in this chapter.

If you opt to forgo taking your class's starting equipment, you may roll the amount of starting wealth you have on the table below based on your class. Then, buy any amount of equipment you'd like from the stores listed in this chapter, *not including exotic or black market equipment*.

## Wealth

While Belly (฿) is the primary currency used for buying goods and services, wealth can appear in many forms in the One Piece world. Rare weapons, devil fruits, gemstones, gold, treasure, and other valuables can all be exchanged for other equivalent items or for a portion of their value in Belly (depending on bartering skills). 

Because Belly is the world's primary monetary unit, it is what most islands and nations use to trade. You are free in most places to trade an item that is considered to be worth a set amount in Belly for an item of equivalent value in Belly. Occasionally, other forms of currency may be found and used on different islands around the world (typically if they are secluded from other major islands and nations). Some of these currencies have unknown conversion rates in canon, but you may choose to use the conversion tables down below.

### Belly (฿) Paper and Coins
Belly is a currency that is given value by the world government and various nations and kingdoms around the world. Not all islands use Belly as the standard currency, though most will be willing convert it over to their nation's currency. Belly has six known coin denominations and three known paper denominations, with no fractional units (though the DM may make additional denominations if desired). The denominations are as follows: 
* Coin: ฿1, ฿5, ฿10, ฿50, ฿100, and ฿500
* Paper: ฿1,000, ฿5,000, and ฿10,000

### Belly (฿) Conversion

Converting different currencies, such as Belly in the One Piece world and the precious metal coins in the Forgotten Realms is a simple process. This conversion isn't considered canon, but it is solid approximation of the worth of each currency when converted to a different type of currency.

Many islands and nations separated from the rest of the world often use alternate forms of currency that can be used for trading within their borders. Additionally, most of the time you can exchange Belly (฿) for an amount of that nation's currency equal to the number of Belly (฿) exchanged.

##### Extol
Extol is the currency used in Skypiea. This currency can be use and traded with across a number of sky islands, and can also be exchanged for Belly (฿). 

The standard exchange rates is **10,000 Extol = 1 Belly (฿)**.

##### Gor
Gor is the currency used in Amazon Lily. Although the exchange rate isn't officially defined in canon, you may use the below exchange rate.

The standard exchange rate is **100 Gor = 1 Belly (฿)**.

##### Silver, Gold, and Platinum
Silver, Gold, and Platnium are the standard currencies used in Wano Kuni. You may use the above table of exchange rates for corresponding precious metal coins to determine exchange rates within Wano Kuni.

### Selling Treasure
After journeying across several islands and uncovering various hidden treasures, you may decide to sell what you don't wish to keep in exchange for a large sum of Belly (฿), provided that you find buyers who can afford to do so.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** Undamaged armor and weapons will typically sell for half of their cost when sold to any market. Any standard damaged or used equipment won't have much value to any buyer.

**Devil Fruits, Cursed/Named Weapons, and Other Rare Items.** Unlike ordinary equipment, devil fruits and special weapons or equipment aren't easily damaged and can be sold for extremely high prices in a black market. The price they are sold for may depend on how legitimate the buyer is or how desperate they are to obtain it. Underground auctions are another way to get a large sum of money for any rare item. Ordinary markets or civilians will not be able to afford these types of items.

**Gems, Precious Metals, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items may be found inside treasure chests, sunken ships, or unexplored ancient ruins. Regardless, these items retain their full value in any reputable marketplace. For large amounts of treasure and valuables, your DM may require you to find a particularly wealthy buyer or marketplace in a large city.

**Trade Goods.** Across most islands and continents, raw materials such as ore, salt, grain, and livestock will often retain their full value in any market across the world, much like Gems, Precious Metals, Jewelry, and Art Objects.

## Armor and Shields

The level technology and innovation in the One Piece world varies across islands and continents around the world. Some of the rarest forms of armor can be found in the Marines' possession or in markets across the grand line. 

Many pirates and marines will wear armor and gear that makes seafaring more comfortable and painless, though some may opt to wear heavy armor helps them last in battle. Metallic Heavy armor doesn't last long in seawater, hinders mobility, and should not be preferred when traveling by boat. Therefore, you must find vendors who will sell effective equipment that works for a life of pirating and seafaring. It is up to each character and their class to decide what armor is worth using.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the world of One Piece.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a Shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or Attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast Spells.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows Disadvantage in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** Many warrior-type pirates supplement their armor with a Shield. A Shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a Shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one Shield at a time.

### Light Armor
Made from light materials and fabrics, light armor provides a solid balance of mobility and protection for the swashbuckling and seafaring types. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your arm or type to determine your Armor Class.

**Dense Coat.** This type of coat is a made from durable fabrics and materials that provides basic protection.

**Thick Shirt.** Thicker shirts consist of high-quality quilted cloth or leathers that don't hinder flexibility.

**Light Bulletproof Shirt.** An undershirt consisting of durable synthetic fibers that provides noticeable protection against bullets and other weapons.

### Medium Armor

Medium armor is similar to light armor, but sacrifices mobility in exchange for greater protection through its thicker fabrics and materials. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.




CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

\page

**Hide.** This crude armor is made from various thick beast skins and pelts. Tribal groups, evil humanoids, and savages often wear this type of material for protection.

**Bulletproof Jacket.** A protective jacket consisting of durable synthetic fibers that provides decent protection against bullets and other weapons without making too much noise.

**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Bulletproof Suit.** This armor consists of fully bulletproof materials made from durable synthetic fibers. Your vital organs are completely protected by this suit, though your legs and arms are left partially uncovered.

**Sea King Half Plate.** This half plate armor is crafted from nearly impenetrable Sea King hide and scale plating that covers most of the wearer's body.

### Heavy Armor

Although not always preferred for seafaring and pirating, heavy armor can provide the greatest protection out of any type of armor. It is worn by those who possess great strength and juggernaut capabilities.

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

**Ring Mail.** This armor is leather arm or with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor.

**Chain Mail.** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Splint.** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

**Steel Wootz Armor.** Consists of shaped, interlocking steel plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, giant shoulder plates, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Sometimes comes in a gold coating.

## Weapons

Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a pistol, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the world of One Piece, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A **melee weapon** is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a **ranged weapon** is used to attack a target at a distance.

### Weapon Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats give you the ability to gain Proficiency in certain types of weapons. These types of weapons are categorized as **simple** and **martial**.

When you have proficiency in a weapon type, you can add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. When you don't have proficiency in a weapon type, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

### Weapon Properties
The different types of special weapon properties are listed on the different Weapons table. These include **ammunition, finesse, heavy, light, loading, range, reach, special, thrown, two-handed,** and **versatile**. These properties function the same as they do in standard 5th edition D&D rules.

### Improvised weapons

When characters decides to use a tool or item that could be used as a potential weapon, the DM may allow them to use it as an improvised weapon. If a character is proficient with improvised weapons or if the improvised weapon is similar to a type of weapon, such as a club, the DM may allow the character to add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

When an improvised weapon is used, the damage die is a 1d4 (the damage type is decided by the DM based on the weapon). It may be used as a melee weapon or a thrown weapon depending on the weapon. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Lance.** You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.

**Net.** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are form less, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

## Adventuring Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

**Acid.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.

**Antitoxin.** A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.

**Attack Cuisine.** A character who eats this powerful meal regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Eating it all takes an action.

**Ball Bearings.** As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level area 10 feet square. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.

**Block and Tackle.** A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.

**Book.** A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on dial contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures.

**Caltrops.** As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.

**Candle.** For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.

**Case, Gun Bullets.** This wooden case can hold up to twenty gun bullets or five bazooka rounds.

**Case, Map or Scroll.** This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.

**Chain.** A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check

**Climber’s Kit.** A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25
feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.

**Component Pouch.** A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).

**Crowbar.** Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crow bar’s leverage can be applied.

**Fire Explosive.** Explosives require a method of being lit using heat or fire, and then being thrown. As an action, you can throw this explosive up to 20 feet, letting it explode where it lands. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the explosive as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. If it hits a flammable material or object, it will begin to burn away a random 5-foot cube of the material each round. A creature can end this damage or fire spread by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames or toss water on it.

**Fishing Tackle.** This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.

**Handcuffs** These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the handcuffs requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of m anacles com es with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the handcuffs' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Handcuffs have 15 hit points.

**Healer’s Kit.** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

**Holy Symbol.** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. A Priest can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the D&D 5th Edition Player's Handbook. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.



**Holy Water.** As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.

A priest may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses ฿250,000 worth of powdered silver and special salts, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.

**Hunting Trap.** When you use your action to set it, this trap form s a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground.
A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use
its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

**Lamp.** A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

**Lantern, Bullseye.** A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

**Lantern, Hooded.** A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

**Lock.** A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.

**Log Pose.** A log pose, similar to a compass, helps navigators find their way to nearby islands or locations. However, log poses are special in that they are the only way to navigate on the Grand Line, since regular compasses don't work there. A log pose is used by spending a certain amount of time on an island (which could take hours, days, or years) to record the magnetic waves required to point it toward the next nearby island. Paradise log poses do not work in the New World, so a New World log pose is required to navigate there. New World log poses are 10 times more expensive than an ordinary log pose.

**Mess Kit.** This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.

**Oil.** Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as
an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**Poison, Basic.** You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.

**Pouch.** A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other
things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).

**Power Source.** A power source is a special item—a battery, a special dial, an energy crystal, a fuel rod, or a similar item—designed to channel the power of abilities and spells. A tinkerer can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the 5th Edition D&D Players Handbook.

**Quiver.** A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.

**Ram, Portable.** You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.

**Rations.** Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.

**Rope.** Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.

**Scale, Merchant’s.** A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.

**Spyglass.** Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.

**Tent.** A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.

**Tinderbox.** This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.

**Torch.** A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

### Tools

Your class, race, and background will give you proficiency with tools. Tools are designed to assist you in performing a certain task such as repairing, building, playing music, or any other similar activity. When you are proficient with a certain type of tool, you add your proficiency bonus to checks made when using that particular tool. Tool checks can use a number of different abilities, not just one.

For the most part, these tools operate the same as they do in D&D 5th Edition, with a few exceptions.

**Artisan’s Tools.** These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The Tools table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan’s tools requires a separate proficiency.

**Disguise Kit.** This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.

**Forgery Kit.** This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.

**Gaming Set.** This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Poker). A few common
examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.

**Herbalism Kit.** This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.

**Musical Instrument.** Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

**Navigator’s Tools.** This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator's tools lets you chart a ship's course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid
getting lost at sea.

**Poisoner’s Kit.** A poisoner’s kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to
craft or use poisons.

**Thieves’ Tools.** This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal
handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your
proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks.

## Mounts and Vehciles

Mounts, although difficult to bring out to sea, can be a great way to get to different places on land. Carriage, carts, wagons and other drawn vehicles can be pulled by multiple mounts to carry the weight more efficiently. Some mount prices in the One Piece world are listed below, although there are other rare creatures the DM may let you use.


CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

\page

**Barding.** Barding is arm or designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of arm or shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent arm or made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

**Saddles.** A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount. A colossal saddle is required for riding any creature that is gargantuan or larger.

**Exotic Mounts.** Some mounts, especially those found in various islands within the Grand Line, are far more special than ordinary mounts. Mounts marked in the table below as exotic are only found and domesticated on certain islands. For example, Bananawani are normally only found in Alabasta or other extreme arid climates around the world.

**Vehicle Proficiency.** If you have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.

**Renting a Mount.** Renting a cheap mount typically costs ฿1,000 an hour in most locations. Renting a more expensive or exotic mount will typically cost ฿2,000 an hour when made available.

*Mounts that are bold are considered exotic.*

*Waterborne vehicles that are bold, or similar items, cannot be built or purchased in most locations, and can only be crafted by special builders in certain locations.*

**Waterborne Vehicles.** Most ships and other waterborne vehicles are the common method of transportation in this world. Crew max determines the amount of crewmates that can permanently reside on the vehicle. An additional number of temporary passengers may also fit on the boat, equal to the crew max. Daily miles traveled on waterborne vehicles equals the speed x 24. More information on waterborne vehicles and ships are found in the One Piece D&D DM's guide.



CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

\page

## Special Equipment

Certain items are often considered far too advanced for the majority of the One Piece world, and are instead mainly used by powerful factions or groups within the grand line. Many forms of technology have been seized and monopolized by the World Government and Marines. However, some of this equipment may still be usable by adventurers if attained.

### Dials

Dials are mysterious devices made from sea shells that each hold a unique power. They are normally found throughout the sky islands, and often vary in size and power. 

Some are used for completing simple tasks such as cooking, refrigeration, or blowing air, while others can be used to enhance weapons or deal devastating amounts of damage to enemies.

Common dials are easy to come by when exploring sky island. However, it may be difficult to discover more rare and powerful dials on your own. Purchasing or trading to attain special rare dials is one way to gather them, but they may not be available in many shops. Therefore, finding them in dungeons or well-guarded fortresses might be the only way to get a rare dial that you want.

#### Finding a Simple Dial

Searching for the more simple dials is easy when you're traveling through the sky islands, especially along the shorelines. Finding dials, especially rare ones, outside of any sky islands is incredibly difficult. 

When searching along shorelines throughout the sky islands, such as the shore of the White-White Sea, a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check may be rolled for every 24 hours spent searching to see if a character locates a Simple Dial shell. If a character is proficient in using Dials, they make this check with advantage.

If a character succeeds on finding a simple dial, have them roll a d20 and use the Simple Dial Table below to determine which dial they receive.

#### Finding a Rare Dial

Rare dials are far more difficult to find than ordinary dials. They are often larger, store massive amounts of energy, and are used in warfare and advanced machinery. In order to find a rare dial, it may be required to search sky island ruins or dungeons to discover such powerful dials. 

If a character does find a way to locate a rare dial, the DM may choose to roll a d20 on the Rare Dial Table or pick from it when giving it to the character.

#### Using a Dial
Each type of dial has a special ability that may be more useful or powerful than others depending on the desired outcome. Dials work by sapping power from a source of energy, impact, or element, then pushing a button on the shell to expel everything built up within the dial to perform any type of task.

CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

\page

Simple dials tend to have less overwhelming or dangerous abilities, and absorb less from their designated energy source on average. Rare dials are often incredibly effective in combat, and some have the power to devastate both their user and any foe from the amount of power they can expel in an instant. 

Being proficient in dials allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any check or attack roll when using a dial. Dial effects for both simple and rare dials are listed below.

**Breath Dial.** By storing air, gases, or wind currents, breath dials have the ability to emit anything it absorbs as a gust of energy. Simple breath dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you can absorb up to a 5-foot cube of any gas or wind. By pressing the button on the dial as an action, you can expel up to a 5-foot cube of any stored gas in a space within 5 feet of you. For example, if you absorbed poisonous gas, you may fill up any 5-foot square of space within 5 feet of you with this poisonous gas you as an action. Any creature in the space being filled with gas must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check or be pushed out of the space away from the dial. Objects less than 10 pounds are also pushed out of the space automatically. Simple breath dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of gas, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Breath Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of gas. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead. You can also use a large breath dial to power a standard waver, reducing the cost of building a waver by 80%.

**Flavor Dial.** Similar to breath dials, flavor dials specialize in storing gases and scents. This includes explosive gas or foul odors. However, flavor dials aren't capable of emitting strong gusts that can push things away. Simple flavor dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you can absorb up to a 5-foot cube of any gas or scent. By pressing the button on the dial as an action, you can expel up to a 5-foot cube of any stored gas in a space within 5 feet of you. Simple flavor dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of gas, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Flavor Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of gas. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Freeze Dial.** By absorbing freezing substances or gases, freeze dials can be used to chill and cool off anything by expelling cold elemental energy. Simple freeze dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may sap cold energy from any 5-foot cube of material or gas that is 0° C (32° F) or less in temperature, such as ice, snow, or frigid air by placing it within 5 feet of the source. To use this dial, as an action, you can place or hold the dial in a 5-foot square, then press the button on it to keep that space at freezing or cool temperatures for up to 24 hours for every 5-foot cube of stored cold energy released. This can be used for freezers or refrigerators. Alternatively, you can release all the cold energy stored in a freeze dial to make an attack. As an action, you can make a melee attack against a creature and release the cold energy within the dial to deal 1 cold damage for every 5-foot cube of cold energy expelled. Simple freeze dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of cold energy, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Freeze Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of cold energy. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Heat Dial.** By absorbing hot substances or gases, heat dials can be used to heat up anything by expelling hot elemental energy. Simple heat dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may sap heat energy from any 5-foot cube of material or gas that is 100° C (212° F) or more in temperature, such as fire, magma, or burning gas by placing it within 5 feet of the source. To use this dial, as an action, you can place or hold the dial in a 5-foot square, then press the button on it to keep that space at burning or boiling temperatures for up to 24 hours for every 5-foot cube of stored cold energy released. This can be used for ovens or heaters. Alternatively, you can release all the heat energy stored in a heat dial to make an attack. As an action, you can make a melee attack against a creature and release the heat energy within the dial to deal 1 fire damage for every 5-foot cube of heat energy expelled. Simple heat dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of heat energy, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Heat Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of heat energy. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Lamp Dial.** By absorbing light from any source, a lamp dial can emit bright light for an extended period of time. Simple lamp dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may absorb up to an hour worth of light or sunlight, for each charge spent, into this dial by holding it or placing it within range of the source without interruption. To use this dial, as an action, you can press the button on the dial to continuously shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet from the dial for a duration equal to the amount of stored light in hours. Simple lamp dials can store up to 5 hours worth of consistent light, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Lamp Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 10 hours worth of light. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Milky Dial.** This dial only works in extremely high altitudes, such as any location in the sky islands. By absorbing giant chunks of clouds into a milky dial, you can release pathways or blocks of cloud from the dial. Simple milky dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may absorb any 5-foot cube of island or sea clouds by placing it within 5 feet of the source. To use this dial, as an action, you can place or hold the dial in a 5-foot square, then press the button on it to release a 5-foot cube of island or water cloud stored, depending on the type of clouds absorbed, within 5 feet of the dial once at the beginning of every round. Each 5-foot cube of this cloud has 1 HP and AC 6, and will float slowly in any direction it is expelled or pushed, up to 5 feet per round. Simple milky dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of cloud, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Milky Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of cloud. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.


CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

\page

**Thunder Dial.** By absorbing electric elemental energy from a material or current, thunder dials can be used as an electric power source to anything by channeling stored electricity. Simple thunder dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may sap electric energy from any 5-foot cube of material or current that is releasing or channeling electricity, such as a lightning rod, active wiring, or generator, by placing it within 5 feet of the source. To use this dial, as an action, you can place or hold the dial in a 5-foot square, then press the button on it to channel electricity into one nearby device for up to 24 hours for every 5-foot cube of electric energy stored being released. This can be used for simple machines such as a fan or light bulb. Alternatively, you can release all the electric energy stored in a heat dial to make an attack. As an action, you can make a melee attack against a creature and release the electricity within the dial to deal 1 lightning damage for every 5-foot cube of electric energy expelled. Simple thunder dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of electric energy, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Thunder Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of electric energy. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Tone Dial.** This dial can store sounds or spoken messages to replay them out loud at a later time when activated. Simple tone dials have 5 charges. By expending any number of charges from this dial as a bonus action, you can record up to 10 seconds for each charge spent of any sound or spoken message. As an action, you can press the button on the dial to play any stored noise or message, which can be heard up 120 feet away from the dial depending on the volume. Additionally, stored messages can be replayed or looped for up to an hour each day, or can be erased in up to 10 second segments as an action. Simple tone dials can store up to 50 seconds of sound or speaking, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Tone Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 100 seconds of sound, which can be replayed or looped infinitely. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Vision Dial.** By capturing and absorbing visible colored light in an area, vision dials can capture photos and print them onto paper or parchment. Simple vision dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you can capture a single photo in one direction. As an action, you can press the button on the dial to print the stored image onto a piece of paper or parchment and delete the stored photo data on the dial. Simple vision dials can store up to 5 individual photos at a time, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Vision Dials (rare) can record videos for up to 10 seconds for every 2 charges spent, have 10 charges, and can store up to 10 photos or videos at a time. Videos can be played back on a projector created by the large vision dial, and can have individual frames printed out. Photos and videos can also continue to be stored without getting deleted after being printed. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Water Dial.** This dial can absorb and store any type of water or liquid and then release it when activated. Simple water dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may absorb any 5-foot cube of water or liquid by placing it within 5 feet of the source. To use this dial, as an action, you can place or hold the dial in a 5-foot square, then press the button on it to release and pour up to 5 cubic feet of stored liquid, within a space up to 5 feet of the dial once at the beginning of every round. This liquid can be stored in containers, or poured over surfaces or even fires to put them out. Simple water dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of liquid, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Large Water Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of liquid. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.

**Axe Dial (Rare).** Are incredibly powerful damage-dealing dials that can amplify the effects of attacks. They can be attached to your body or combined with any weapon to amplify its effects. By passively absorbing and storing sharpness from a blade, weight from a blunt weapon, strength from the user's fists and legs, etc. an axe dial will greatly enhance any attack made with a weapon it is attached to. The are three different types of axe dials, each type increasing in both strength and rarity. 

A +1 axe dial (*uncommon*) will give any weapon, including your unarmed strikes, a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls when attached.

A +2 axe dial (*rare*) will give any weapon, including your unarmed strikes, a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls when attached.

A +3 axe dial (*very rare*) will give any weapon, including your unarmed strikes, a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls when attached.

In order to attach an axe dial to a weapon or body part, the user must spend time during a short or long rest properly fitting and attaching it to the desired weapon. A weapon can only receive the benefits from one dial at a time, and the effects of separate dials on a single weapon do not stack. Furthermore, axe dials do not stack with innate weapon bonus stats, and can only increase a weapon's innate bonuses up to a total +3 for attack or damage rolls. However, axe dial bonuses do stack with bonuses from character feats and abilities. For example, a +3 supreme grade meito would receive no benefits from an axe dial and a +2 great grade meito would only increase to a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the weapon if it had a +3 axe dial attached to it.

**Ball Dial (Rare).** This dial is almost identical to the large milky dial (use the description from *Milky Dial.*), except when segments of solid cloud are produced from this dial, they become floating 5-foot diameter balls that can be attached to eachother without breaking. They each have 1 HP and AC 6, and can be pushed up to 30 feet in any direction as a ranged attack, popping on impact with the first thing they touch. Additionally, when a cloud ball is destroyed or popped, it will produce a random effect. Roll a d100 on the wild magic surge table (D&D standard 5th edition rules) to determine the effect, and have the effect target and damage the creature closest to the ball or the ball itself after popping. If the rolled effect grants sorcery points or doesn't have an applicable effect, re-roll on the table instead.

**Eisen Dial (Rare).** The eisen dial is considered one of the strongest types of dials. This dial is almost identical to the simple milky dial (use the description from *Milky Dial.*), except when segments of solid cloud are produced from this dial, they are as thick and durable as iron. They have 30 HP and AC 20 per 5-foot cube released, and will shatter into metallic dust when destroyed. Additionally, by releasing a 5-foot cube of stored cloud, you may transform it into an iron simple melee weapon of choice that you can use. If you are proficient with rare dials, you are also proficient with the created weapon. This weapon lasts for 1 hour, or until it is dispelled as a bonus action, in which it will crumble into metallic dust afterwards.

**Flash Dial (Rare).** This dial is very similar to a lamp dial, but instead releases stored light in a powerful flash that can blind enemies. Flash dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may absorb up to an hour worth of light or sunlight, for each charge spent, into this dial by holding it or placing it within range of the source without interruption for the desired amount of time. To use this dial, as an action, you can press the button on the dial while holding it to release an hour worth of stored light in a powerful instant flash of blinding light. Each creature aside from the user within 30 feet of the dial has to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn. Flash dials can store up to 5 hours worth of consistent light, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Flame Dial (Rare).** By absorbing flames or burning materials, flame dials can be used to release scorching bursts or beams of fire. Flame dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may sap fire from any 5-foot cube of fire, magma, or burning material by placing it within 5 feet of the source. To use this dial, as an action, you can release a burst of flames from the dial, one ray for every stored 5-foot cube of fire released, and hurl them at targets within 120 feet. Make a ranged attack for each burst of flame created. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage. Flame dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of fire, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Impact Dial (Rare).** By absorbing an instance of damage or force from an incoming attack, you can store and later release the force in a devastating burst of concentrated energy. Impact dials have 5 charges. When the user is individually targeted by an attack, spell, or damaging effect, they can use the impact dial to absorb the damage or a portion of it by expending charges as a reaction. Roll a d10 for every charge spent, and reduce the damage of the attack, spell, or effect by the number rolled and store that amount inside of the dial as part of that same reaction. The number stored cannot be more than the total amount of damage rolled by the attack, spell, or effect targeting the user of the dial. Additionally, if the damage rolled by the attack, spell, or effect is reduced to 0, it is nullified and has no effect. 

To release the stored damage as a concentrated shock wave, the user can spend an action to make a melee attack against a target with the dial, deciding how much stored damage to expend. On a hit, the target takes a number of force damage equal to the expended damage. Whether the attack hits or misses, the user of the dial will be damaged by half of the expended force damage (rounded down) as recoil in force damage as well. Impact dials can store up to 30 force damage at once, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If the stored force damage reaches its cap, any carryover damage that cant be absorbed when attempting to nullify an attack is still dealt to the user and isn't reduced.

**Jet Dial (Rare).** By storing powerful gusts or wind currents, jet dials have the ability to emit anything it absorbs as a gust of energy. Jet dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you can absorb up to a 5-foot cube of any strong wind or gas. By pressing the button on the dial as a bonus action, you can expel at least one 5-foot cube of stored wind to launch you 30 feet x every 5-foot cube of stored wind released in any direction. Jet dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of wind, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn. Additionally, attaching a jet dial to a waver will double its speed.

**Reject Dial (Rare).** Reject dials are one of the strongest and hard to find dials among even the rarest dials. However, reject dials are also incredibly dangerous to use, with the recoil being able to potentially kill anyone who uses them. This dial is almost identical to the impact dial (use the description from *Impact Dial.*), except it has 10 charges, can store up to 60 force damage, and regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Storm Dial (Rare).** This dial is almost identical to the simple milky dial (use the description from *Milky Dial.*), except when segments of solid cloud are produced from this dial, they come in the form of condensed chunks of powerful storm clouds. Every 5-foot cube of storm cloud can be passed through, though it is considered Difficult Terrain. Any creature that ends its turn inside a created storm cloud must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the harsh maelstrom of wind inside the cloud. Additionally, at the start of each round, each 5-foot cube of storm cloud will target the closest creature within 30 feet and deal 1d6 lightning damage to it. Storm clouds only last for 1 minute after being created, in which they return to being an ordinary island or sea cloud after.

### Pop Greens

Pop greens are special seeds that have the power to instantly grow into full plants that produce a desired spell effect. Pop greens can be imbued with various effects or spells by a skilled herbalist, allowing them to be used as soon as they are planted in dirt or soil. Creating a pop green requires having a Herbalism Kit, supplies, a nearby spellcaster, and being proficient in the Nature or Arcana skills. 

Additionally, they can only be created during extended periods of downtime, such as when traveling by boat to a new location in clear weather or spending time on a peaceful island.

#### Creating a Pop Green

A pop green is made by placing the energy from any spell and the material components required into a special seed. Creating a pop green can take a specific amount of time and money related to the strength and level of the Pop Green the characters wants to imbue into the seed, as shown on the table below. Additionally, the character creating the pop green must have proficiency in the Nature or Arcana skills and provide any material components required by the spell being put into the pop green. Moreover, at least one character making the pop green or assisting in the creation process must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character's known spells, in order to create the pop green.

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st Level.

Pop greens are occasionally found on various islands or sold in black markets. They can be sold to certain rich buyers for a price equal to the material cost on the table above. Their cost in the black market often equals 120% of their cost on the Pop Green Cost Table.

```
```



#### Using a Pop Green

When a character possesses a pop green, he or she can use at any time by planting it in a patch of dirt, soil, or sediment nearby. The pop green can be planted as an action, bonus action, or reaction (depending on the spell) within 5 feet of the user. It can also be thrown or fired by a sling as an action up to 30 feet away from the user into a nearby patch of soil. When the pop green is planted, it will begin casting the spell stored inside of it, no material components required. 

The plant created will begin casting the spell from itself. For example, if the plant created from a pop green has cone of cold stored in it, it will cast it immediately after the action the user made to plant it, blasting the 60-foot cone from itself and damaging all enemies in the range depending on the direction the user wants it to aim the spell. After the spell is finished being casted or concentrated on, it will wither and die. 

If the plant casts a spell, such as time stop, that can only target the caster, it will instead target the creature that planted it if they are within 30 feet of the plant. Otherwise, the plant will target itself with the spell before withering and dying. If the spell requires a target, the person who planted the pop green can verbally command it to choose the desired targets. Additionally, if the spell has a casting time longer than an action, the plant will remain alive and actively cast the spell until it is casted. Also, if the spell requires concentration, the plant will remain alive and attempt to concentrate on the spell until the duration ends or concentration is lost. Once the spell is no longer being concentrated on or is finished casting, the plant instantly withers and dies.

While the plant remains alive, its stats are as follows (Treat cantrips as 1st-level spells when determining these stats). It is a large plant, its HP is equal to 5 x Spell Level (Minimum 5), its AC is equal to 10 + Spell Level (Minimum 10), it has vulnerability to fire damage, and its Constitution save bonus for keeping concentration is equal to the Spell Level. The plant's appearance depends on the type of spell stored by it. For example, if it has the fireball spell stored, it may have a reddish-orange patterned appearance, a bazooka-shaped stem, and flame-shaped leaves. The plant may also cast or create the spell effect by emitting magical effects from its stalk or mouth, or by attacking with segments of its body.




CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

The spell casted by the plant has an Attack Bonus and Save DC depending on the level of the spell stored by the plant, shown on the table below.

#### Pop Green Complications

If the creature planting the pop green is a spellcaster that already knows how to cast the spell being stored by the pop green, planting it will always work without fail.

However, if the creature planting the pop green doesn't already know how to cast the spell being stored by it, there is a chance that the pop green will fail to grow and will die before it casts the spell successfully. In this case, the creature planting it must make an Intelligence (Nature) or Intelligence (Arcana) check to determine whether they plant it successfully or not. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the plant dies and has no other effect.

### Stars

Stars are special types of ammo that deal additional damage compared to ordinary ammo or have some form of additional effect when fired. These can be crafted by a tinkerer or marksman, or found and purchased throughout the adventure. 

Crafting a star requires any type of appropriate artisan's tools (such as mason's tools or smith's tools), proficiency in the Arcana or Sleight of Hand skills, and proficiency in at least one type of ranged weapon. The rarity, cost, and time it takes to make a batch of 5 for each type of star is listed in the Star Cost Table. Machine gun ammo, sniper rifle ammo, and bazooka ammo require double the time and money to make. Sling bullets require half the time and money to make.

1 workweek
฿1,000,000

Rare

฿5,000,000

Very Rare

฿25,000,000









Each batch of stars created from the table above comes with 5 of the desired type of ammo. Once a star is used or fired, it cannot be used again. If a star misses a target after being fired, it has no effect and becomes useless.

#### Types of Stars

Individual batches of stars can come in many forms, depending on their rarity. Below are the different types of stars you can create.

**Metallic Star.** This type of star is much heavier and more destructive than ordinary ammo. Uncommon metallic stars have a +1 to attack and damage rolls when fired, rare metallic stars have a +2 to attack and damage rolls when fired, and very rare metallic stars have a +3 to attack and damage rolls when fired. Additionally, targets that are medium or smaller that are hit by a metallic star must succeed on a Strength save against a DC equal to 10 + (attack/damage bonus of the star x 2), or be knocked prone.

**Flame Star.** A flame star ignites mid-air, igniting anything it hits on contact. Uncommon flame stars deal an addition 1d6 fire damage when fired, rare flame stars deal an additional 2d6 fire damage when fired, and very flame metallic stars deal an additional 3d6 fire damage when fired.

**Smoke Star.** This star creates a sphere of smoke centered on a point within range on impact with a target. An uncommon smoke star creates a sphere radius of 10 feet, a rare smoke star creates a sphere radius of 20 feet, and a very rare smoke star creates a sphere radius of 30 feet. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

**Cactus Star.** This star explodes upon hitting a target, piercing nearby targets with flying spikes. If this star hits a target, it will damage all creatures within 5 feet of the target for 1d4 piercing damage if it is uncommon. If it is rare, it will damage all creatures within 5 feet of the target for 2d4 piercing damage. If it is very rare, it will damage all creatures within 5 feet of the target for 3d4 piercing damage.

**Terror Star.** When this star hits a target, a terrifying vision appears in front of them. Until the end of their next turn, they are frightened of you for the duration. If it is a rare terror star, they also take 1d4 additional psychic damage. If it is a very rare terror star, they take 2d4 additional psychic damage instead.

### Meito

A meito is a world-class blade of exceptional quality. These blades were made by some of the best craftsmen in the world, and come in many shapes and sizes. They are far superior to regular blades, and have the power to slice through just about any material.

There are a limited number of meito in the world, and each can sell for several hundreds of millions of Belly (฿) or more depending on the rarity. Finding these swords, or even individuals who will sell these swords, should be incredibly difficult to accomplish for ordinary pirates. The four grades of meito and the number of each in existence are listed in the table below.


Meito Grades



Grade
Number of Blades




Regular
Unknown


Skillful
50


Great
21


Supreme
12









#### Regular Grade

Regular grade meito are the lowest classification for a meito blade, but are still exceptional in quality and sharpness compared to ordinary blades. Any weapon considered a regular grade meito will typically have a +1 bonus to Attack rolls.

#### Skillful Grade

With only 50 skillful grade blades in existence, this classification of meito are known to be extremely light, sharp, and powerful. Attuning to a skillful grade meito may also grant the user special abilities or bonuses while using the weapon. Any weapon considered a skillful grade meito will usually have a +1 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls.

#### Great Grade

Known to be the second rarest grade of meito with only 21 in existence, great grade meito are only a slight bit weaker than supreme grade meito. Despite this, they are still some of the few strongest swords in the world. Attuning to a great grade meito may also grant the user special abilities or bonuses while using the weapon. Any weapon considered a great grade meito will typically have a +2 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls.

#### Supreme Grade

Being the rarest grade of meito in the world, supreme grade meito are 12 of the strongest blades ever crafted. This grade of meito has the ability to slice through mountains like butter if wielded by a capable user. Attuning to a supreme grade meito may also grant the user special abilities or bonuses while using the weapon. Any weapon considered a supreme grade meito will always have a +3 bonus to Attack and Damage rolls.

```
```



#### Black Blade

Any meito or weapon that has become black in color through long-term use officially becomes a black blade. Black blades are considered indestructible, and can never be destroyed under any circumstance. Additionally, if a meito is less than supreme grade and becomes a black blade, it automatically advances up a grade in strength, gaining higher stats. Black blades may also come with additional powerful effects or boons, such as the ability to deal extra necrotic damage when rolling a critical hit. If a user of a meito turns their blade into a black blade, feel free to use the table below to determine what bonus the black blade gains. Gaining the effects of special bonuses requires the user to attune to the blade.


#### Cursed Blade

Cursed blades, such as kitetsu swords, are known to bring doom and misfortune to its user over time. However, if tamed, cursed blades can be extraordinarily fearsome in battle. Every cursed blade comes with a downside to being used recklessly, and each cursed blade may have a more crippling effect than the last depending on how high the grade is. When the user of a cursed blade attunes to it, they must succeed on a contested charisma check against the cursed blade (charisma bonus of the blade is decided by DM). 

If the user loses the contest, they will attune to the blade and gain a random form of indefinite madness (Standard D&D 5th Edition Rules). If the user wins the contest, they may attune to the blade regularly. After attuning, the only way to end the attunement is to use a remove curse spell. While attuned, the user will gain access to a special ability while using the blade (feel free to roll on the table below to decide the ability). However, there may also be a severe drawback equivalent to the benefit the sword offers. For example, a cursed blade may deal an additional 2d6 necrotic damage to a target on a hit, but will deal 1d6 force damage to its owner every time an attack misses.


Special Blade Bonuses

### Underworld Marketplace

The Underworld is a colossal crime syndicate that is known to carry smuggled goods and trade them off to bidders in underground auctions or markets. Its main operations are found on the Grand Line, and many different types of pirates, nobles, and notorious figures bid for extremely rare (and often very illegal) goods and services they wouldn't be able to purchase elsewhere.

Some towns may have underworld marketplaces and black markets readily available and easy to find for wealthy buyers, while other locations may attempt to hide their dealings away from officials. Goods sold in these auction houses and marketplaces may include extremely rare or exotic items such as devil fruits, powerful weapons, and legendary materials. Sometimes this auction houses also commit more horrific crimes such as capturing non-human races, selling slaves, or auctioning away weapons of mass destruction.

The price of a good depends on its rarity, as listed in the table below. Because items are often auctioned away in these markets instead of being regularly sold, it may be possible that a bidder will need to pay more (or very rarely less) than the standard asking price for more popular items.

Common items are easy to find in these markets, if their price is high enough to warrant being auctioned. Uncommon items are less common, and typically these markets will only have 1d8 uncommon items in each marketplace. Rare items are also pretty hard to attain, with only 1d6 possibly existing in each marketplace that sells them. Very rare items are among the hardest to find, with a 25% chance of there being any very rare items in the marketplace to begin with, in which case there may be 1d4 of these types of items. Lastly, legendary items are almost never sold in auction houses or underworld marketplaces. However, there is a 10% chance a single legendary item will be offered by a high-ranking underworld broker or official. In this case, it will likely be sold for an extraordinarily high price, or be given away in some high-stakes competition.

#### Underworld Smuggled Goods

Various types of rare items are available in the Underworld Markets. As shown on the table, some of these items have different types of rarity.

**Slaves.** Slaves are commonly sold at many exclusive underworld auction houses. Common slaves may include captured low-level pirates, commoners, and animals. Rare or Legendary slaves may include more exotic non-human races, such as merfolk or fish-men. 

**Rare Supplies.** These supplies are nearly impossible for ordinary citizens to buy, as they are typically extracted from materials that are illegal or difficult to find. For example, Adam Wood is a type of Very Rare wood that can be used to build top-tier ships. However, this wood can only be bought through the underworld market due to how difficult it is to find or purchase normally.

**Devil Fruit.** Devil fruits are among some of the rarest items in the world. However, some random devil fruits may be sold in underworld auctions. If a Very Rare devil fruit is being sold, its powers are unknown and must be rolled on the Devil Fruit Table (Chapter 7) only after being eaten.

CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT

\page

If a Devil Fruit being sold or auctioned is Legendary in rarity, its powers will be known and stated by the seller before the bidding begins. These devil fruits are among the strongest, and typically come in the form of a powerful Logia, Mythical Zoan, or rare paramecia type.

**Meito.** Details about Meito blades are listed earlier in this chapter. A cursed meito will be sold for half the minimum cost initially, though it will not be stated that the sword is cursed.

**Dials.** Detials about different types of dials are listed earlier in this chapter. The strongest dials may have a starting price many times higher than the minimum cost of rare dials.

**Illegal Weapons.** Illegal weapons are often weapons of mass destruction and arms deemed to be so dangerous that they have been deemed highly illegal to use. Being banned by the World Government, having these weapons in your possession is punishable by death. Uncommon illegal weapons have the potential to wipe out an average-sized house. Rare illegal weapons have the potential to wipe out an entire block of buildings. Very rare illegal weapons have the potential to wipe out a small village. Legendary illegal weapons have the ability to destroy a large town. To determine the deadliness and effects of a type of illegal weapon, have it work similarly to a pop green or spell scroll of the same rarity. 

An uncommon illegal weapon may have the effect of a Fireball spell, a rare illegal weapon may have the effect of a Cloudkill spell, a very rare illegal weapon may have the effect of a Fire Storm spell, and a legendary illegal weapon may have the effect of an Earthquake or Meteor Swarm Spell. Each weapon may differ in use and intensity, and some may be far more catastrophic than even the deadliest known spells if the DM allows it. They may also work similar to expendable magic items in standard 5th Edition D&D rules, such as a Necklace of Fireballs.

**Rare Equipment.** Certain types of equipment, such as armor, guns, rings, or other types of gear are considered so rare and expensive that they are only occasionally sold in underworld auctions or markets. This equipment being sold may include items similar to +1 Armor, magic rings, or vicious weapons.

**Devil Fruit Encyclopedia.** These books are among some of the rarest items in the world, with only a few ever being printed. Devil Fruit Encyclopedias can be used to automatically identify most types of Devil Fruit and give basic information on its appearance and powers. When observing a Devil Fruit with this book, you or the DM may view the official [Devil Fruit Encyclopedia](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/24DkobVl8IGZ) to identify its name and properties without needing to consume it.

**Eternal Pose.** Eternal Poses are special log poses that always point toward a particular island. This makes finding that specific island very easy, and getting lost is almost impossible. The rarity of the eternal pose depends on how legendary the location is.

### Den Den Mushi

Den Den Mushi are a species of telepathic snails that can be used for vocal communication, similar to telephones. Den Den Mushi are often modified by people to have dials, receivers, and other accessories built into to their shells and bodies, allowing for humans and other creatures to utilize their telepathy and use them for long distance communication with other modified Den Den Mushi.

Some Den Den Mushi are modified to serve as makeshift telephones, some are modifed to serve as cameras, or other transmission devices. Very rare Den Den Mushi devices may be used for other specific purposes, such as intercepting other Den Den Mushi. Additionally, some may be modified and painted to resemble their owners.

**Standard Den Den Mushi.** The most commonly used Den Den Mushi have telepathic abilities that allow them to serve as telephones. When two Den Den Mushi connect to each other, any sound that plays into one will be transmitted and sent over to the other and be perfectly replicated by the receiving Den Den Mushi, and vice versa. This is essentially the same as calling someone with a telephone. There may be limitations to the signal range of most Den Den Mushi, aside from few rare ones that have nearly unlimited range.

**Baby Den Den Mushi.** Are much smaller audio-based Den Den Mushi that can be concealed in clothing to avoid detection. However, this comes at the cost of having a weaker signal range.

**Black Den Den Mushi.** Is a Den Den Mushi that intercepts and listens into other audio-based Den Den Mushi communicating, being able to save any messages they record and memorize them for playback. These are often used by government agents and the marines.

**White Den Den Mushi.** Is a very special type of Den Den Mushi that prevents any nearby Black Den Den Mushi from eavesdropping. These are incredibly rare, and are typically used by Revolutionary agents.

**Visual Den Den Mushi.** Are Den Den Mushi that record and relay visual information in order to play it back later in the form of photographs or videos. These Den Den Mushi can capture photos or record videos and then project them back onto screens by using their powerful flashing eyes for others to see. In other words, they often serve as both cameras and image or video projectors.

**Special Den Den Mushi.** Are the rarest variety of Den Den Mushi reserved for top world officials. These are used to relay emergency messages to other Den Den Mushi. For example, a Golden Den Den Mushi can be used to send an emergency signal to a Silver Den Den Mushi, which will order a Buster Call assault onto an island or location.

## Expenses

Sometimes long journeys across the ocean allow for some extended periods of downtime while occasionally stopping by various islands to gather supplies. Even stepping away from the dangerous life of pirating for a while and spending time in a small village or large city isn't all that uncommon for those looking for a short break from the unforgiving seas. However, living comfortably in any situation can cost quite a bit of money. Depending on a character's lifestyle and career, these expenses will begin to stack up over time.

### Lifestyle expenses

Maintaining a decent home or ship cabin, purchasing food and water, maintaining your gear and equipment, and covering transportation each day in a village or city will vary in cost depending on the quality of these goods and services required by a character. 

Someone who decides to live with spending on only the bare minimum will pay far less than someone maintaining an elite noble lifestyle, for example. The cost of living for each lifestyle preference is listed in the table below.


Lifestyle Expenses



Lifestyle
Price per day




Wretched
-


Poor
฿2,000


Comfortable
฿10,000


Wealthy
฿40,000


Rich
฿100,000


Noble
฿1,000,000 minimum









**Wretched.** You choose to live in horrible conditions, often stealing scraps of food or dumpster diving for survival. Your gear is never maintained and you almost never care for your appearance. You may reek of body odor and look to be suffering from malnutrition.

**Poor.** You have found ways to live for very cheap, albeit in not very comfortable conditions. Only being able to afford the bare necessities, such as a few slices of bread each day, some water, and a small room or place to stay in for shelter. Your gear is poorly maintained, and you may not appear particularly clean.

**Comfortable.** You are considered roughly middle-class and can afford a decent house in a modest part of town, or a small room on a ship or in an inn. You have access to clean water, average food, and other basic necessities. You take care of your equipment and your appearance is clean and acceptable.

**Wealthy.** A step up from the comfortable lifestyle, you belong on the upper tiers of society. You may own a large house, have a decent-sized living space on a ship, or regularly lodge at a high-quality inn. Your equipment is kept in great condition and your appearance and cleanliness is certainly well above-average.

**Rich.** You live a life of luxury, and might even be popular throughout your homeland or other nearby towns. Perhaps you are a prestigious pirate, aristocrat, or successful business owner. You may own a mansion, stay in a large room on a ship, or even own an inn or two. Your equipment is kept in mint condition and you always dress in the best clothes available.

**Noble.** Nobles are often world-class elites, top pirates, or celestial dragons that have access to nearly infinite sums of money at their disposal. The lifestyle of a noble allows for just about any expense to be easily covered. You may own several homes, ships, or buildings all around the world. Nobles have immediate access to the best clothes, the best perfumes, some of the finest weapons, and always keep their equipment in perfect shape.

# Chapter 6: Customization & Feats
Even after customizing your race, class, and background, there are more steps to developing and customizing your character's abilities and features. If you wish to take multiple classes for your character, you will use many of the same rules for multiclassing listed in the standard D&D 5th Edition ruleset. If you wish to include some or all the classes and player feats from standard D&D in a campaign using the rules in this guide, feel free to use the unaltered player feats and multiclass rules from the standard books.

For the purposes of advancing characters using the rules listed in this pdf, follow the rules below.

## Multiclassing

Because these One Piece themed classes haven't been thoroughly tested and balanced for multiclassing, it is possible that multiclassing may break some of the game balance in a campaign. If you still insist on doing so, here are the the rules, prerequisites, and proficiencies you will gain from multiclassing using classes in this pdf.

#### Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a bruiser who decides to multiclass into the skald class must have both Strength and Charisma scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.

##### Multiclassing Prerequisites
| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Bruiser  | Strength 13 and Constitutiton 13 |
| Chemist | Wisdom 13 |
| Devilforged | Charisma 13 |
| Hybrid | Charisma 13 |
| Marksman | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Martial Artist  | Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13 |
| Priest | Wisdom 13 |
| Rogue | Dexterity 13 |
| Skald | Charisma 13 |
| Tinkerer | Intelligence 13 |
| Warrior | Strength 13 or Dexterity 13 |

#### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your level in a particular class. 

```
```

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together.

#### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.

#### Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class, you gain only some of new class's starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

##### Multiclassing Proficiencies
| Class | Ability Score Minimum |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Bruiser  | Simple Weapons |
| Chemist | Light armor, medium armor, shields |
| Devilforged | Light armor, simple weapons, one tool of your choice |
| Hybrid | - |
| Marksman | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons, one skill from the class's skill list |
| Martial Artist  | Simple weapons, shortswords |
| Priest | Light armor, medium armor, shields |
| Rogue | Light armor, one skill from the class's skill list, thieves' tools |
| Skald | Light armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument of your choice |
| Tinkerer | - |
| Warrior | Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons |

#### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. You don't, however, receive the class's starting equipment, and a few features have additional rules when you're multiclassing: Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

#### Channel Divinity
If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. 


CHAPTER 6 | CUSTOMIZATION & FEATS

\page

#### Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the warrior's version of Extra Attack does).

#### Unarmored Defense
If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can't gain it again from another class.

#### Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the rules as described in that class.

**Spells Known and Prepared.** You determine what spells you know and can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single-classed member of that class. 

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

**Spell Slots.** You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the priest, skald, and tinkerer classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell that you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.



```
```

CHAPTER 6 | CUSTOMIZATION & FEATS

\page

## Feats
A feat defines how your character's abilities develop in relation to their fields of expertise over the course of the adventure. Many of these feats are very much necessary throughout this type of campaign as it provides tools for characters to deal with the likes of Devil Fruit Users and other new types of enemies. 

Additionally, many of these feats require certain unique prerequisites to be met before unlocking them, unless your class or race tells you otherwise. These prerequisites may be in the form of ability score minimums, already having certain feats unlocked, or being a certain race.

You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different damage type.

You master the handaxe, battleaxe, greataxe, warhammer, and maul. You gain the following benefits when using any of them:

# Chapter 7:  Devil Fruits & Haki

Throughout a One Piece themed campaign, what will primarily separate this type of adventure from a standard 5th addition adventure is the inclusion of Haki and Devil Fruits. As players explore, collect new items, and grow as a crew, they may also find Devil Fruits along the way which unlock a whole new door full of magical powers and abilities which they can unlock. 

Alternatively, a character may not wish to fall victim to some of the crippling downsides Devil Fruits often come paired with or take the risk of getting a useless power from one. For this type of player, unlocking Haki abilities over time will become a priority to remain competitively strong. Haki and Devil Fruitp powers are not mutually exclusive, but those who focus on developing Haki will do so at a greater rate than those who focus on developing both Devil Fruit powers and Haki. Haki may also serve as a necessary "counter" to annoying Devil Fruit users throughout an adventure, similar to seastone and water. A character that focuses on developing their Haki will likely find it easier and easier to deal with Devil Fruit powers over time.

These rules and guidelines will provide a far easier and more intuitive way of advancing character features and abilities through haki and devil fruit advancement. By overcoming overwhelming odds, survivng deadly encounters, and learning from defeating powerful enemies, characters will be able to attain these 'advancement features'. Alternatively, character creation rules, races, classes, etc. may allow characters to take "Haki Advancement" features for free. Handing these rewards out to players will inspire them to confront challenges in ways that would defy common sense, as true character growth requires such calls to action to improve one's own strength and spirit against all odds.

```
```

### Spiritual Advancement

Whole crews or individual characters may occasionally find themselves coming out of dangerous encounters just barely alive and declaring victory. In this situation, simple treasure or XP may not be enough to reward their bravery and luck.

As an additional way to reflect such intense character growth, and with the DM's approval, players may be granted a special advancement to their abilities as a gift. When a victory warrants such a reward, it is considered a "Spirit Surge Event". Defeating especially tough bosses, powerful organizations, or overcoming other dangerous encounters might automatically trigger a Spirit Surge Event. Depending on how each player wishes to develop their character, the player may choose between unlocking a Haki or Devil Fruit advancement feature. The rarity of the Spirit Surge Event depends on the level of the challenge each character faced, and it will determine the rarity of the advancement feature unlocked. For example, receiving a Rare Spirit Surge will allow you to unlock a Rare or lower Haki Advancement feat. Use the Spirit Surge Event table below to determine the maximum rarity category of the advancement feature a character is permitted to pick. Keep in mind, you do not always have to use Challenge Rating (CR) to determine the rarity of the Spirit surge Event. Spirit surges can also be handed out to all players as a gift from the DM as an alternative to magic items or other special loot.


Spirit Surge Event



Rarity
Challenge Rating
Example




Uncommon
1 - 4

### Training Surges and Tutors

While the thrill of adventure and the heat of battle can certainly shape a character, more deliberate forms of learning have their place in the journey of character growth. Training provides a way for characters to continue to grow their Haki and Devil Fruit techniques during downtime, but for a price.

#### Training Surges

A Training Surge represents a concentrated period of guided training and practice. These periods can occur during downtime, between quests, or during long sea voyages. They allow characters to focus on honing their abilities, exploring the extent of their powers, or developing new strategies for battle.

To initiate a Training Surge—an alternate method to activating Spirit Surges—a set of prerequisites must first be met. Primarily, a tutor is necessary to begin the process. Locating a qualified tutor can be a challenging task, and the level of Spirit Surge they can impart through training will vary based on their expertise. Although a tutor can instruct multiple students simultaneously, they will charge an individual fee for each trainee. Some tutors may work for free if characters are in their good graces. Once a tutor has been identified and compensated, the trainee must devote a substantial and consistent period to the training, as specified in the 'Training Fees and Time' table provided below.


Training Fees and Time



Spirit Surge Rarity
Training Time
Training Fee




Uncommon
1 week
฿5,000,000


Rare
3 months
฿50,000,000


Very Rare
6 months
฿500,000,000


Legendary
1 year
฿5,000,000,000







During the training period, a character is considered to be in downtime and cannot participate in other activities, adventures, or battles.  They are fully committed to the training and the development of their powers. However, they will be rewarded with enhanced abilities and a deeper understanding of their Haki or Devil Fruit powers at the end of the process.

Once the total training time has gone by without any issues, any creature participating in the training will receive a spirit surge according to the type of training they chose using the table above. 

#### Optional Rule: Solo Training

The DM can alternatively allow a character to train without the guidance of a tutor or mentor. If so, use the table below to calculate training time and cost. The cost represents expenses needed for resources and equipment while training.

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

\page
```
```



## Haki

In the world of One Piece, Haki is a type of spiritual energy that exists in every living creature. Channeling this energy through one's body allows one to achieve a greater tier of power. Haki can exponentially improve a creature's abilities in a variety of ways. It can amplify one's own body, weapons, and ammunition. It can also heighten a creature's senses or even allow for it to develop a "sixth sense". Creatures born with "Qualities of a King" through sheer luck, however, may instead awaken an incredibly rare form of haki known as "Haoshoku Haki" or "King's Haki". Though the chances of a creature being born with King's Haki is around one in a million. Each color of haki can be learned and improved through training and combat experience.

Each type of Haki is categorized as a separate "Color" of Haki. These categories of Haki can be developed instead of Devil Fruit powers through Spirit Surge Events, or might be advanced through other character creation options. There are three known Colors of Haki, as listed below:

* **Color of Armament (or Busoshoku Haki):** A creature that develops this type of haki is able to use its spirit as a weapon or suit of armor it can form around its body and weapons. Weapons and attacks coated with this spiritual energy are able affect Devil Fruit users in ways they normally couldn't, such as being able to damage Logia users through their immunity to physical attacks. This normally invisible or transparent energy can also harden on a creature's body or weapons to become a much darker metallic coating which further amplifies its offensive or defensive abilities. Alternatively, it can be channeled through attacks to emit bursts of spiritual energy and destroy objects or creatures from the inside. Creatures that master this haki become nearly unstoppable juggernauts that deal devastating damage.

* **Color of Observation (or Kenbunshoku Haki):** A creature that develops this type of haki is able to greatly increase its own senses. Creatures using this haki can detect the auras, presence, strength, and emotions of other creatures around them. When developed over time, creatures can even develop a powerful sixth sense that will allow them to see even when blinded or deafened. Furthermore, at its highest level, this haki allows creatures to see into the future to avoid danger. Creatures that master this form of haki will become nearly impossible to evade or hit with ordinary attacks.

* **Color of the Supreme King (or Haoshoku Haki):** A creature that develops this type of haki is able to use their powerful spirit to force others into submission. Users of this haki are able to easily dominate creatures with weaker willpowers both physically and mentally through unleashing their auras. Creatures dominated by this power may either submit, flee, or become fully incapacitated by it. This haki can also be used like the Color of Armament to imbue attacks with energy, making them far stronger than normal. Only a handful of creatures on the planet can master this form of haki, allowing them to achieve heights very few have reached in power.




CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

## Color of Armament Advancement

When deciding to advance your Color of Armament Haki during a Spirit Surge Event, you may choose any of the following features below. The rarity of the haki advancement feature you may choose is determined by the Spirit Surge Event.

*In order to gain a Color of Armament Haki Advancement feature, you are required to have a minimum Constitution score of 11 and meet any other prerequisites mentioned.*

#### Armament Haki Spellcasting Ability
Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your color of armament spells, since the strength of this haki is determined by your overall toughness. You use your Constitution whenever an Armament Haki spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an armament haki spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

You can only amplify an attack this way once per round during your turn. Once you use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

```
```



### Weapon Hardening
*Haki Advancement, Uncommon*

If the attack already has a bonus to its attack and damage rolls, this feature replaces the bonus unless it is greater, in which case it does not gain this feature’s benefit.

This effect ends early if you fall unconscious, use it again, end it as a bonus action, or start your turn not holding or touching the weapon you coated. Once you use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

If the Spirit Surge Event has a rarity higher than Rare, use these bonuses:

**Rare.** The chosen weapon gains a +2 bonus to Attack rolls and Damage Rolls instead.

**Very Rare.** The chosen weapon gains a +3 bonus to Attack rolls and Damage Rolls instead.

Additionally, if the target is a Devil Fruit user, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is unable to use Devil Fruit abilities, spells, or forms until the end of its next turn. Any Devil Fruit spells that use concentration and any Devil Fruit forms or abilities the creature has active are also ended early, as if it was touched by seastone.

Once you use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

If the Spirit Surge Event has a rarity higher than Rare, use these bonuses:

**Very Rare.** You deal 4d10 force damage instead.

### Titan's Grip
*Haki Advancement, Very Rare*

Your spiritual force can now grip even the intangible, enabling you to grasp any attack and withstand its damage.

As a reaction, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you is targeted by a spell or ability that deals damage, you can use your Haki to intercept the attack. The damage is redirected to you, but you only take half damage (rounded down). Once you use this ability a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down), you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.



### Blackened Fist of Ruin
*Haki Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Spirit Blast, Dexterity 15 or Strength 15

Your spiritual energy can focus into a single devastating punch that shatters any defense.

As an action, you can make a single melee weapon attack against a creature within reach. If this attack hits, it deals an additional 10d10 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked back 30 feet and knocked prone. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.


### Crippling Blast
*Haki Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Spirit Blast

You enhance your ability to send bursts of energy through your attacks and can now physically destroy your enemies from the inside.

On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can’t take reactions, until the end of its next turn.

### Dark Armor
*Haki Advancement, Legendary*

You can create a nearly indestructible coat of Haki that guards you from all harm.

As an action, you can envelop yourself in a layer of super-dense Haki. For the next 10 minutes, you gain resistance to all types of damage except force, your Armor Class can't be less than 20, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing, and you are immune to being grappled or restrained. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. Unworn objects automatically fail their saving throw and take full damage. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.



### Element Infusion
*Haki Advancement, Legendary*

**Prerequisite:** Weapon Hardening

Your understanding of elemental energies and spirit manipulation has evolved to such an extent that you can saturate your weapons with massive amounts of destructive force.

When you activate your Weapon Hardening feature on a weapon you are using, you can choose to infuse it with a primal element, causing it to crackle with raw energy. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

For the duration of your Weapon Hardening, each of your successful attacks with the infused weapon deal an extra 5d6 damage of the chosen type. The extra damage applies to every successful hit, even if you make multiple attacks in a turn.

In addition, the weapon sheds bright light in a color corresponding to the chosen element in a 40-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 40 feet.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Abyssal Hole
*Haki Advancement, Legendary*

**Prerequisite:** Spirit Blast, Dexterity 15 or Strength 15

You've refined your Armament Haki to a point where you can channel both its overwhelming force and your intimidating spirit into a single destructive blow, capable of sending foes plummeting into an abyss.

As an action, you can make a melee attack against an opponent within reach. If the attack hits, you envelop your hand in concentrated Haki and smash your opponent into the ground, dealing 10d10 force damage and forcing them to make a Strength saving throw against your Armament Haki save DC. On a failed save, the enemy is sent crashing downwards 50 feet, taking any additional fall damage, and creating a gaping hole in the ground if the area is able to be destroyed, and is knocked prone and stunned until the end of its next turn.

If used on a surface not connected to a substantial amount of earth (such as the deck of a ship or a wooden floor), this ability will instead break through the surface and cause the enemy to fall through, dealing the same amount of force damage to any objects hit. 

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

Only one weapon can receive the benefits permanent infusion at a time, and it only receives the benefits from the Weapon Hardening advancement feature and no other additional haki advancement features that have been applied to it. If a creature other than you attempts to use this weapon, it must attune to the weapon to gain its benefits.

Make a single weapon attack roll. On a hit, the target suffers the normal effects of the weapon attack, and it takes an additional 4d10 force damage.

Then, up to six other targets of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the original target each take force damage equal to the additional force damage roll.

Moreover, once per round on your turn when you hit a creature with the imbued weapon, you can choose to channel the full power of your Haki, dealing additional force damage equal to twice your Proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Creatures of your choice with the Color of Observation haki features that try to use an Observation Haki ability from within the aura must make a Wisdom saving throw against your King's Haki save DC. On a failed save, they are disoriented and can't use observation haki abilities and take disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the start of their next turn.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 

### Conqueror's Bulwark
*King's Haki Advancement, Legendary*

You can fortify not just yourself, but also your allies against the crushing force of other conquerors. Your indomitable spirit stands as a testament of your unyielding resolve.

After taking this feat, you are immune to the frightened condition. You are also immune to any effects that can incapacitate or stun you by means of Conqueror's Haki.

Moreover, as an action, you can extend this powerful protection to your comrades. All allied creatures within a 60-foot radius of you gain immunity to the frightened condition and cannot be incapacitated or stunned by Conqueror's Haki. This effect lasts for 1 hour.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

```
```



### Overpower Devil Fruit Effects
*King's Haki Advancement, Legendary*

You are able to nullify any active devil fruit effects by breaking them with your willpower.

You can cast the Dispel Magic spell at will, without expending a spell slot. This only works on active spells or effects caused or created by Devil Fruit powers.



### Unyielding Conqueror's Wrath
King's Haki Advancement, Legendary

The sheer force of your indomitable spirit is a deadly tempest that can devastate those who oppose you.

As an action, you can release an all-consuming wave of pure willpower that resonates from your very core. All creatures within a 120-foot radius must make a Constitution saving throw against your King's Haki save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 force damage, is knocked prone, and is stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or stunned. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower automatically fail their saving throw.

Structures within the area of effect take twice the damage, and the force of your will can create a massive crater in the landscape, a testament to your potent and unstoppable spirit.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Complete Willpower Domination
*King's Haki Advancement, Legendary*

Your ability to influence other creatures has been mastered to such a degree that you can completely control their very souls.

You can cast the Dominate Monster spell, without expending a spell slot. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Lord's Mirror
*King's Haki Advancement, Legendary*

Your strong spirit can be used to deflect harmful effects back to their origin. When you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or other harmful effect that targets only you (not an area effect), you can use your reaction to force the originator to make a saving throw using the same DC. On a failure, the originator is affected by the spell or effect as if they were the original target. After using this feature, you must finish a long rest before using it again.

### Conqueror's Maelstrom
*King's Haki Advancement, Legendary*

**Prerequisites:** Dread Sovereign's Roar or Resonating Presence

Your will is a force of nature, an untamed storm that can bring even the skies to submission. Your potent Haki can resonate with the atmosphere itself, causing the elements to dance to the rhythm of your spirit.

As an action, you can choose to unleash the full might of your Haki, creating a spectacular atmospheric phenomenon known as a Conqueror's Maelstrom. A column of vibrant azure splits the sky directly above you, creating a heavenly chasm that can be seen for miles around. This imposing rift lasts for an hour, if you fall unconscious, or until you choose to dispel it (no action required).

This monumental shift in the atmosphere carries with it the following potent effects:

* Authority of the Skies: Every creature within a 1-mile radius that can see the sky becomes instinctively aware of your imposing presence and your exact location. The sight of the split sky leaves an indelible impression of your might, potentially changing attitudes of creatures toward you at the DM's discretion.

* Stormbinder's Will: You gain control over the weather in a 1-mile radius centered on you. As an action, you can change the weather conditions: from stormy to calm, from calm to a tempest, or create specific meteorological phenomena such as rain, snow, or dense fog. These conditions persist for the duration and revert to their previous state when the Conqueror's Maelstrom ends.

* Shockwave of Supremacy: While Conqueror's Maelstrom is active, you can send forth a powerful shockwave of your haki as an action. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 300 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your King's Haki save DC or be frightened until the end of your next turn. On a failure by 5 or more, a creature is also stunned until the end of your next turn, overwhelmed by the sheer might of your will.


Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Devil Fruits

Devil Fruits are mysterious fruits that grant the creature or thing that eats it supernatural powers upon being consumed. Once at least a single piece of the fruit enters the stomach of a creature, the fruit itself will revert back to being an ordinary mundane fruit and the creature or thing that consumed it will become quickly aware of the new powers they have acquired as the "Devil" originally inside the fruit enters their body. There are three types of Devil Fruits: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia types. 

Paramecia Devil Fruit users are usually the most common type and gain the power to either change their bodies, alter their environment, or produce a specific type of material. Zoan Fruit users gain the ability to transform into a type of creature. And Logia Fruit Users gain the ability to transform and control a natural element. 

This all comes at the cost of never being able to swim again and becoming weak to water and seastone.


### Finding a Devil Fruit
Devil fruits are very rare, but with enough luck one might find one growing from a tree or plant. When generating an island in your world, the DM can roll a special dice based on the size of an island to determine if there are any Devil Fruits growing somewhere on it. Use the table below to decide which dice you use. 


Island Devil Fruit Growth Chance



Island Size
Dice Type
Find DC




Diminutive
d20
10


Tiny
d12
12


Small
d10
14


Medium
d8
16


Large
d6
18


Colossal
d4
20









Regardless of which dice you use, on a roll of 1 there will be 1d4 Devil Fruits scattered across the island. Characters will be unaware of whether Devil Fruits are growing on an island or not unless they thoroughly search and investigate the island.

To search for devil fruits, characters must declare a Devil Fruit hunt is taking place. Players must spend a week actively searching for Devil Fruits. At the end of this search, everyone must make a group check, using either Wisdom (Perception or Survival) or Intellgience (Investigation or Nature) to beat a DC determined by the island size. If more than half of the party succeeds, one Devil Fruit is located by the creature with the highest roll. Additional searches may be may be made if there are more Devil Fruits to be found on the island.

If a devil fruit user has recently died on an island, there is a greater chance the exact same fruit will respawn on that island. Roll twice instead of once to determine the result if characters arrive or are currently on that island.

There is also a 25% chance a Devil Fruit on an island has already been found and is currently stored somewhere or in the possession of another creature or person.

### Understanding and Appraising Devil Fruits

As rare and powerful entities, Devil Fruits pose a unique allure and conundrum to those lucky enough to stumble upon them. Due to their idiosyncratic nature and diversity of effects, a deeper understanding and appropriate appraisal are essential to effectively identify their power or negotiate their worth.

#### Identification

The first step to understanding a Devil Fruit is analyzing the fruits' external characteristics – their shape, color patterns, and the unique swirling pattern on their skin – which can provide hints about the type of fruit, but the exact power it bestows can only easily be determined only once it is consumed. A rare few scholars and researchers may have compiled libraries or records that contain detailed illustrations and descriptions of certain known Devil Fruits, but such resources are scarce.

Devil Fruit books, available in Underworld Marketplaces, serve as one method for identifying a Devil Fruit. However, these books carry a rarity and cost akin to legendary Devil Fruits, rendering them a challenging method for identification. Nonetheless, Underworld Marketplaces and other special locations may provide a Devil Fruit appraisal service for a substantial fee. Please refer to "Appraisal" for more details about this procedure.

#### Using Spells on Devil Fruits

A Devil Fruit cannot be influenced or identified by standard spells or abilities unless explicitly stated in the spell or ability's description. An example of this is the "Locate Devil Fruit Power" spell found in Chapter 8. The supernatural properties of Devil Fruits appear to deflect these effects, rendering them immune to regular identification methods or alterations to their properties.


```
```

#### Appraisal 

Certain Devil Fruits can be identified by a knowledgeable appraiser. Although finding a competent appraiser can range from challenging to nearly impossible, it might be a more cost-effective alternative than purchasing a Devil Fruit Book. Even if a skilled appraiser is found, there is only a 50% chance the Devil Fruit can be identified. An appraiser will generally demand a substantial fee based on the rarity of the provided fruit if it is successfully appraised, as indicated in the Devil Fruit Appraisal Fee table below.


Devil Fruit Appraisal Fee



Rarity
Price




Uncommon
฿2,500,000


Rare
฿5,000,000


Very Rare
฿10,000,000


Legendary
฿25,000,000









Underworld Marketplaces also provide an avenue for cheaper Devil Fruit appraisals. These illicit marketplaces or auction houses can offer the same service at half the price, thanks to their extensive networks and knowledge bases. However, this affordability carries a risk. Appraisers from Underground Marketplaces are known to occasionally overvalue or misidentify Devil Fruits to maximize their profit. In fact, there is a 25% chance that an appraiser will either lie or misidentify a Devil Fruit during its appraisal.

Additionally, in order to identify the Devil Fruit's exact powers and category as a part of the appraisal, there is generally a flat rate of ฿10,000,000 to get further information about its abilities. This price is reduced down to ฿5,000,000 for Underground Marketplaces, but carries the same risk as mentioned previously.

## Devil Fruit Generation

 Using these guidelines will help make the generation of random devil fruit found throughout the world and their users much easier.

### Devil Fruit Rarity
Once you've confirmed that a Devil Fruit has spawned on a particular island, consult the Power Rarity table below to ascertain the fruit's power rarity. If preferred, the DM can make the selection from the table instead. After pinpointing the rarity, proceed to the respective rarity tables in the subsequent pages to determine the exact name and nature of the Devil Fruit power. Once more, the DM may roll on these tables to determine the name and power of the devil fruit, or manually select from them.

Uncommon and Rare devil fruits are entirely made up of standard Zoan and Paramecia powers. Very Rare and Legendary devil fruits are made up of a mixture of strong Paramecia type powers, special Zoan powers, and even Logia powers.



Power Rarity

### Devil Fruit Encyclopedia

Many Devil Fruits listed in the Devil Fruit tables are comprehensively detailed in the [Devil Fruit Encyclopedia](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/24DkobVl8IGZ). This book also offers additional rules and guidance for incorporating Devil Fruits into your campaign. For a deeper understanding of Devil Fruits in your game, it's strongly recommended to consult the Encyclopedia alongside this section.



### Starting With Devil Fruit Powers

If the DM allows for it, a player character may begin the campaign with a Devil Fruit instead of a Haki ability. To make this process fair and not give players an overwhelming advantage over their non-power using allies, they will only be permitted to roll on the *Uncommon* Devil Fruit table to determine their starting power. You could also allow a player to start with a high rarity Devil Fruit power, but use the Optional Rules presented in the Devil Fruit Encyclopedia to allow them to scale throughout the campaign.

## Designing a Devil Fruit Sheet with Steps

Upon consuming a Devil Fruit, one gains supernatural abilities almost immediately. However, this newfound power comes with a price: a profound vulnerability to sea water. While all Devil Fruit consumers share common weaknesses, some may also possess unique susceptibilities.

The [Devil Fruit Encyclopedia](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/24DkobVl8IGZ) serves as an excellent way of easily implementing Devil Fruits into your campaign, though you are free to just use it as a template. It provides a foundational guide for Dungeon Masters aiming to design or adapt a Devil Fruit. Typically, Paramecia users draw spells from any class, Zoan users undergo animal transformations reminiscent of druids, and Logias blend spellcasting with transformative capabilities. This design approach aligns closely with the creation of magic items in standard D&D 5e.

### Step 1: Category & Appearance

First mark the name of the devil fruit, its rarity (uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary), its type (paramecia, zoan, or logia), and subtype. The subtype of a devil fruit depends on its type. For example, a Hie Hie no Mi (Ice) logia devil fruit will have a "Solid" subtype of logia. Give a brief description of its abilities based on the type.

Additionally, the devil fruit will have a unique and peculiar shape, color, and pattern decorating it. Perhaps draw a sketch of it or describe its unique appearance to players.

*The example below shows the process of designing the Bara Bara no Mi fruit using this template.*


##### Example: Bara Bara no Mi (Dividing)
*Devil Fruit, Uncommon*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia
	
**Description.** Can split and divide parts of your body into pieces and can control said pieces telekinetically.
	
**Fruit appearance** Dark red berries decorated with spiral patterns.
	



### Step 2: Strengths and Features

A devil fruit user becomes almost immediately aware of which devil fruit power it has upon consuming it. The Strengths and Features of each type of devil fruit are further detailed in each respective section in later pages.

Some of your devil fruit features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects. Additionally, your devil fruit may require making a spell attack. If a devil fruit spell requires using an ability modifier to be used, instead use a number equal to every rarity category past common (minimum of 1). For example, a Rare devil fruit would have a value of 2 (two higher than common).

The saving throw DC and Attack modifiers are calculated as follows:

**Devil Fruit save DC** = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + one point for every rarity category higher than common (min 1)

**Devil Fruit Attack modifier** = your Proficiency Bonus + one point for every rarity category higher than common



```
```


##### Example: Bara Bara no Mi (Dividing)
*Devil Fruit, Uncommon*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia
	
**Fruit appearance.** Dark red berries decorated with spiral patterns.
	
**Description.** Can split and divide parts of your body into pieces and can control said pieces telekinetically.

**Cut Immunity.** You are immune to slashing and piercing damage, as your body can divide to avoid sharp objects.
	
**Floating Limbs.** You can use the Mage Hand cantrip. Additionally, when you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 30 feet greater than normal.	



#### Optional Rule: Long Rest Recharge
Instead of Devil Fruits regaining charges at each dawn, your DM may allow you to regain all expended charges upon completing a long rest. This would replace the usual recharge of Devil Fruit abilities at the next dawn.

### Step 3: Weaknesses

Devil fruit users are doomed to "become a hammer" for the rest of their lives, meaning they cannot swim. If their powers are particularly useful, that might be an acceptable tradeoff for many. Additionally, you can never eat another devil fruit or you will die.

Upon gaining devil fruit powers, you are permanently weak to sea water, sea stone, and similar bodies of liquid. This can make a seafaring adventure fairly difficult, even if your devil fruit power is particularly strong. Marines and other powerful pirates may also have access to various seastone weapons that will immediately weaken you and nullify your powers. Being a strong devil fruit user can often make its user feel like they have become gods, giving them a great advantage over most foes. However, it can be considered a great burden over time, and requires great care and caution to avoid drowning or being captured because of the weaknesses that come with it.





#### Universal Weakness: Becoming a Hammer
When you gain the powers of a devil fruit, your swimming speed becomes 0 forever. Additionally, if you are more than half submerged in any body of water or similar liquid, you become incapacitated until you are no longer submerged. While incapacitated this way, you cannot use any devil fruit features and any devil fruit abilities you have activated will end. If you become fully submerged, you begin to sink and you may hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + Constitution Modifier (minimum 30 seconds) before you drown. Once you begin drowning, you drop to 0 HP, and you can survive a number of rounds equal to your Constitution Modifier (minimum 1). Only when you are able to breathe again will you become stabilized.

The speed at which you sink depends on how much armor you are wearing. If you unarmored or wearing light armor, you sink at a rate of 5ft/round. If you are wearing medium armor, you sink at a rate of 10ft/round. And if you are wearing heavy armor, you sink at a rate of 15ft/round.



CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

\page


#### Universal Weakness: One Devil Per Body

When a devil fruit enters your body, you will never be able to eat another devil fruit for the rest of your life. Some may not be aware of this fact, and will be doomed to meet a horrible fate when trying to do so. If a character eats more than one devil fruit, they immediately drop to 0 HP and explode, dying instantaneously. If they are somehow brought back to life by a specific spell or ability, such as wish or true resurrection, they will no longer have devil fruit powers.

#### Universal Weakness: Seastone 
Seastone, similar to sea water, can completely incapacitate any devil fruit user that comes into contact with it. If a devil fruit user ever comes into direct contact with seastone, they must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution Save, or become incapacitated until the start of their next turn or so long as they are in contact with the seastone. This save must be repeated at the start of each turn so long as the creature is in contact with seastone. While in contact with seastone, you cannot use any devil fruit features and any devil fruit abilities you have activated will end.

#### Optional Weakness: Fruit Vulnerability

A devil fruit may come with a vulnerability or weakness depending on the nature of its power. More powerful devil fruits, such as legendary devil fruits, might not have any exploitable weakness aside from sea water and seastone. However, less powerful devil fruits may have explotable weaknesses. For example, a devil fruit that allows its user to create a flammable material will be vulnerable to fire and will begin to burn each round when catching on fire. Or a logia devil fruit power that makes its user into lightning might be immune to non-magical physical damage except for attacks made from insulating materials such as rubber. 





##### Example: Bara Bara no Mi (Dividing)
*Devil Fruit, Uncommon*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia
	
**Fruit appearance.** Dark red berries decorated with spiral patterns.
	
**Description.** Can split and divide parts of your body into pieces and can control said pieces telekinetically. However, the user's feet cannot float and must be on the ground.
	
**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Cut Immunity.** You are immune to slashing and piercing damage, as your body can divide to avoid sharp objects.
	
**Floating Limbs.** You can use the Mage Hand cantrip. Additionally, when you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 30 feet greater than normal.
	



> ##### Design Tip
> A devil fruit may have unusual weaknesses, such as requiring the user to be sitting or prone to use their abiliites. This can make seemingly overpowered devil fruits more balanced in the longrun.








### Step 4: Devil Fruit Spells, Skills, and Charges

Devil Fruit users start with a set number of devil fruit charges they can use to use spells or special abilities. Expended charges are regained daily at dawn. The number of charges a devil fruit user has, as well as the highest level of spell it can cast using these charges, is determined by the rarity of the fruit shown on the table below. A spell being cast using a devil fruit usually requires spending a number of charges equal to its spell level. Zoan devil fruits do not use charges or spells.


Devil Fruit Charges and Spells



Rarity
Highest Spell Level
Charges




Uncommon
	3rd
5


Rare
	5th
9


Very Rare
	7th
13


Legendary
	9th
17












##### Example: Bara Bara no Mi (Dividing)
*Devil Fruit, Uncommon*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia
	
**Fruit appearance.** Dark red berries decorated with spiral patterns.
	
**Description.** Can split and divide parts of your body into pieces and can control said pieces telekinetically.
	
**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Slice Immunity.** You are immune to slashing and piercing damage, as your body can divide to avoid sharp objects.
	
**Floating Limbs.** You can use the Mage Hand cantrip. Additionally, when you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 30 feet greater than normal.
	
**Spells (Chop-Chop Carnival). ** This devil fruit power has 5 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components:: longstrider (self; 1 charge), blur (2 charges), kinetic jaunt (2 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.



### Step 5: Devil Fruit Advancement and Awakening

A devil fruit user can advance their powers over time and even eventually "Awaken" their devil fruit. Devil Fruit Awakenings are usually unlocked at later levels, granting a powerful awakening ability that depends on the devil fruit type, and it will often break the rules the devil fruit normally follows (such as highest spell level allowed). See "Devil Fruit Advancement and Awakening" later in this chapter for more. 

The example awakening below is an extension of the above devil fruit sheet for the Bara Bara no Mi. 




**Awakening (Telekinetic Carnival).** You can use an action to cast the Telekinesis spell.  You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.

## Designing A Paramecia Devil Fruit Sheet

Paramecia Devil Fruits are one of the three types of devil fruit classifications, allowing their users to achieve superhuman feats by modifying their bodies, producing and conjuring materials, or affecting their environment. These rules will help you design a Devil Fruit for a paramecia user.

### Paramecia Subtypes
**Body Enhancer**, **Substance Generator**, and **Environment Alterer** are the three subtypes of paramecia devil fruits that defines a paramecia user's abilities. Each paramecia will normally limit its user's powers to one of these three subtypes. A body enhancer can only alter their own body and clothes using their powers, a substance generator can only produce a specific type of substance around and outside of their body, and an environment alterer can only transmute or change the properties of objects and people around them. It isn't always clear what subclass a paramecia fruit may belong to, so work with your DM to decide what makes the most sense. 

For example, the Toge Toge no mi (Spike Paramecia) could classify as either a "body enhancer" or "environment alterer" subtype, allowing you to either make your body spiky or make the area around you spiky. However, you must pick only one of these two subtypes before continuing to develop the rest of your abilities. The only exception to this rule is if you "awaken" your devil fruit powers later on, which will give you the ability to bypass the limitations of your paramecia subclass. 

If it is difficult to decide the logical subtype of a paramecia, simply determine it randomly or roll a 1d3. 1 - Body Enhancer, 2 - Substance Generator, 3 - Environment Alterer.


#### Paramecia Type: Body Enhancer
If your devil fruit makes you into a **Body Enhancer** power user, you can now change the properties of your body in various ways. This subtype is most likely to use *transmutation*, *illusion*, or *abjuration* spells on oneself.

For example, the Bara Bara no mi (Chopping Paramecia) and Kilo Kilo no mi (Weight Paramecia) under the body enhancing subclass will allow you to divide your body into floating segments or increase and decrease the weight of your body.

#### Paramecia Type: Substance Generator
If your devil fruit makes you into a **Substance Generating** paramecia power user, you can now produce a certain type of material from your body. You can use this substance as armor, to create a held weapon, or to create structures and barricades. This subtype will typically use *evocation*, *conjuration*, or *abjuration* spells focused on offensive or defensive creation of a substance or material.

For example, the Doku Doku no mi (Poison Paramecia) will produce poison around the user's body that can be sprayed at enemies or used as armor. Alternatively, devil fruits such as the Bari Bari no mi (Barrier Paramecia) can allow their user to create substances a bit farther away from their body. This can depend on the range and target of the devil fruit.




#### Paramecia Type: Environment Alterer

If your devil fruit makes you into a **Enviornment Altering** paramecia power user, you can now control, transmute, or change the properties of the environment around you. This means you can control creatures, objects, space, time, or the air and atmosphere around you depending your specific power. This subtype will typically use magic that affects other creatures or manipulates the environment such as *enchantment*, *necromancy*, *illusion*, *transmutation*, or *divination* spells.

For example, the Noro Noro no mi (Slowing Paramecia) allows its user to make time move slower in certain areas around them for a limited period of time.

### Paramecia Damage Type, Resistances, and Immunities

Paramecia devil fruit users will almost immediately notice that they are immune to certain types of elemental or physical attacks. 

For example, a rubber body paramecia fruit will make its user immune to bludgeoning and lightning attacks because rubber typically nullifies that type of damage. Working with your DM, decide which of the following features apply to you based on your devil fruit's power and nature.

#### Devil Fruit Feature: Paramecia Attacks
It might make sense for certain spells to work especially well for a paramecia devil fruit, but they may not list a damage type in the spell description that corresponds to the devil fruit's element or material. For example, if you wish to use the cone of cold spell for an acid-natured devil fruit, you may list "deals acid damage instead" for the spell on the devil fruit sheet.

#### Devil Fruit Feature: Paramecia Resistances and Immunities
A paramecia devil fruit power grants *at least* one type of resistance or immunity to a damage type or condition that would align with the devil fruit's nature. 

For example, a user of the Bomu Bomu no mi (Bomb Paramecia) might be immune to fire damage, a user of the Gomu Gomu no mi (Rubber Paramecia) might be immune to non-magical bludgeoning and all lightning damage, and a user of the Oto Oto no mi (Sound Paramecia) might be immune to thunder damage and being deafened.

Magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, such as from a creature using Armament Haki, will overcome resistances and immunities.



CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

\page

### Paramecia Basic Skills

Every paramecia-type devil fruit will have at least one ability or attack that can be used innately so long as the devil fruit user is not incapacitated or exposed to water or seastone. Cantrips work well for this purpose, as they can be used infinitely for little to no cost. 

Alternatively, devil fruit abilities might extend or amplify a character's already existing traits. For example, the Bara Bara no Mi and Gomu Gomu no Mi devil fruit powers allow the user to extend their limbs a great distance. This could allow the user of these powers to effectively extend their melee attack reach by 30 ft and use the Mage Hand cantrip to represent this extended limb reach.

A devil fruit should always come with such a basic skill that costs nothing. If a special basic skill is too powerful to be used infinitely at no cost, it might be wise to limit the number of times it can be used each day (or require recharging at the next dawn to be used again).

The example sheet below shows an early design idea for the Nuke Nuke no Mi using paramecia immunities and resistances as well as basic skills.


##### Example: Nuke Nuke no Mi (Phasing)
*Devil Fruit, Rare*

**Type.** Body Enhancer Paramecia

	
**Fruit appearance.** Translucent purple apple with blue stripes
	
**Description.** Allows its user to phase through physical objects and forces physical projectiles and weapons to pass through the user as well.
	
**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Weapon Immunity.** You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, as physical objects pass through you. However, attacks made of living tissue do not phase through you, meaning you are not immune to unarmed strikes for example.
	
**Phase Movement.** You can choose to pass through physical objects as if they were difficult terrain, similar to a specter's incorporeal movement. However, this feature does not allow you to pass through living creatures. You take 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
	
Additionally, you can choose to allow any creature or object you are touching or grappling to share this feature with you so long as they are touching you.



> ##### Design Tips
> Attempting to balance these basic abilities should depend heavily on the leniency of the DM and the rarity of the devil fruit power. For example, a Legendary devil fruit might even allow for the casting of certain leveled spells at no cost, whereas Uncommon and Rare devil fruits should be far more strict with what can be used without expending any resources. This could even go as far as limiting uncommon devil fruit basic abilities to one or two cantrips only.








### Paramecia Spells, Skills, and Awakening

Designing and deciding which spells and skills which can be used with a devil fruit can be tricky at first. Hopefully, after following these steps, choosing paramecia devil fruit spells will become a little more intuitive.

Also be sure to refer back to "Designing a Devil Fruit Sheet with Steps" under step 4 for more examples and an explanation on devil fruit charges and which spell levels to choose from.

To decide which spells to choose from, make sure you keep their spell level beneath the "highest spell level" equal to or lower than the number decided by the devil fruit's rarity. The spell you choose can be from any 5e class spell list. Next, select at least 1 or more spells within that range and modify them as needed. Remember to stick to the rules of paramecia subtypes in order to decide what these spells will be allowed to target, such as "self only" for body enhancers. 

A good example for this might be for a Bomu Bomu no Mi (bomb human) devil fruit user to be able to cast *Burning Hands* (1 charge) and *Fireball* (3 charges), representing how its user can use skills involving explosions of fire. Additionally, an awakening ability might be a much higher level spell than can be used once per day, even bypass the spell level limit for that devil fruit. For a Bomu bomu no Mi user, this could be the ability to cast *Fire Storm* once per day.

Here is another more in-depth example below still using the Nuke Nuke no Mi, a rare type devil fruit, as a template to show which type of spells and awakening ability might be appropriate to use.




**Spells.** This devil fruit power has 9 charges. Using your ability to phase through nonliving materials at rapid speeds and reappear somewhere else, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Absorb Elements (1 charge), Misty Step (2 charges), Blink (3 charges), Far Step (5 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.
	
**Awakening (Reality Phase).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Etherealness. You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.
	









CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

## Designing a Zoan Devil Fruit Sheet

Zoan Devil Fruits are one of the three types of devil fruit classifications, allowing their users to transform into a specific type of animal or creature. Zoan type devil fruit powers are typically the second most common to find. However, mythical zoan devil fruits are extremely rare and difficult to find, similar to logia devil fruits.

Zoan users use their powers a little differently than paramecia and logia types. Instead of being provided with a devil fruit sheet, such as with the other two types of devil fruits, they are instead given a beast stat sheet corresponding to their zoan animal and must follow the rules below.

### Zoan Subtypes
**Standard Zoan**, **Ancient Zoan**, and **Mythical Zoan** are the three subtypes of zoan devil fruits that defines a zoan user's abilities and what creature they can transform into. Standard zoan subtypes are very common among zoan devil fruit users, whereas ancient and mythical zoans are incredibly rare and nearly impossible to find normally.

Standard zoan users are typically able to transform into commonly known animals such as dogs, cats, insects, birds, elephants, or even humans. Ancient zoan users can transform into less commonly known ancient creatures or animals such as dinosaurs, mammoths, or other extinct creatures. Mythical zoan users can transform into incredibly rare creatures that are known only to exist in fiction, such as a phoenix, hydra, or dragon. Mythical zoan users have magical powers that far surpass the abilities that are commonly given to standard or ancient zoan users.

Here are templates you can use to determine the beast form you can transform into using your zoan devil fruit power. 


#### Zoan Type: Standard Zoan (Uncommon)

If the zoan devil fruit you received is uncommon in rarity, the animal you can transform into is likely a commonly seen animal such as a cat, dog, pig, etc. 

#### Zoan Type: Standard Zoan (Rare)

If the zoan devil fruit you received is rare, the animal you can transform into is likely a more ferocious wild animal such as a bear, lion, wolf, gorilla, hawk, etc.

#### Zoan Type: Ancient Zoan (Very Rare)

If the zoan devil fruit you received is very rare, the animal you can transform into is a beast that lived in ancient times such as a mammoth or dinosaur.

#### Zoan Type: Mythical Zoan (Legendary)

If the zoan devil fruit you received is legendary, the animal you can transform into is a creature from mythology such as a dragon or phoenix. This type is both the rarest and strongest of all the zoan subtypes.

```
```


### Beast Shape

If you are a zoan devil fruit user, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast corresponding to your devil fruit (use creature statistics from standard D&D Monster Manual and other books). You can use this feature a number of times determined by the rarity of the devil fruit, as shown on the table below. You regain all expended uses daily at dawn.

The DM will provide you with the stats for your zoan creature, which should be available in a number of D&D 5e resource books or online. If the DM cannot find a fitting stat block for your zoan creature, or it is higher than the CR maximum for your type, they will need to create a custom stat sheet for it. More information on this process is included under the "Custom Zoan Creature Creation" section.

The Devil Fruit's rarity determines the CR range of the beast you transform into at first, and is also shown in the Beast Shapes table below. The zoan creature selected for beast shape does not need to be equal to the Max CR of its rarity type.



Beast Shape



Zoan Rarity
CR Range
Daily Uses
Example




Uncommon
1/8 - 1/2
2
Wolf


Rare
1/2 - 2
2
Brown Bear


Very Rare
2 - 8
2
Tyrannosaurus Rex


Legendary
8 - 20
1
Phoenix









You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your character level (rounded up). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, become incapacitated by seastone or water, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.

* When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.





CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

\page


* You can’t cast spells, and your ability take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.

* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.

* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### Hybrid Form

As a zoan devil fruit user, you immediately gain certain benefits from your devil fruit. You can increase one ability score of your choice up to the same modifier type value listed on your zoan creature's stat block, if there are any ability scores higher than yours. You can only increase one ability score up to your maximum for that score. For example, if you have a Strength score of 10 and your zoan creature has a Strength score of 15, you can increase your strength score to 15. Also, after this change takes place, you can continue to advance the increased ability score gaining the benefits from further ability score increases from character level advancement, boons, etc. 

Additionally, you can use your action to enter a "hybrid" zoan state, combining a mix of qualities from both your humanoid form and beast form together for a temporary period of time. This hybrid form incorporates strengths of your zoan animal into your character's regular skills and stats. You cannot be in your beast shape and hybrid form at the same time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency bonus. The transformation lasts for a number of minutes equal to your half your character level (rounded up), or until you end it as a bonus action, become incapacitated by seastone or water, or fall unconscious. You regain all expended uses daily at dawn.

When you enter your hybrid form, you gain a number of different hybrid feature options equal to 1 + one point for every rarity category higher than common your devil fruit is. The hybrid option features you can choose from are listed below, and last for the duration of the transformation.

```

#### Hybrid Form Options

When customizing your hybrid zoan form, be sure to pick options that make sense for your zoan animal. Consult your DM if you are unsure.

**Keen Senses.** Depending on your zoan animal, choose sight, smell, or hearing. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on that sense.




**Camouflage.** Your skin, fur, scales or overall exterior changes to help you better blend in to your environment. You have advantage on Dexterity (Sealth) checks.

**Pack Tactics.** As a pack animal, you are able to coordinate with allies better while attacking. You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Razor Claws.** If your zoan creature has claws, you also grow claws for the duration of your hybrid form. You can now choose to deal slashing for your unarmed strikes, which you are now proficient with, and your unarmed strike damage dice becomes at least 1d6 + Strength when attacking with your claws. In addition, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed or a burrow speed equal to half your walking speed (pick only one that applies).

**Outer shell.** You form a dense shell, reptilian scales, an exoskeleton, or otherwise defensive exterior. Your AC can’t be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing for the duration of your hybrid form.

**Wings.** You grow wings resembling your zoan animal type. You have a flying speed of 60 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing heavy armor.

**Beast Sensory.** If your zoan creature has darkvision, blindsight, or tremorsense, you can replace your normal vision with one or more of these senses with a range equal to the creature's sense range. For example, if your zoan creature has blindsight 30 ft., you also gain this sense for the duration of your hybrid form.

**Powerful Jaws.** If your zoan creature has fangs or any other form of sharp teeth, mandibles, pincers, etc. on or near its mouth, you also gain those features near your mouth for the duration of your hybrid form. You can now choose to deal piercing damage for your unarmed strikes, which you are now proficient with, and your unarmed strike damage dice becomes at least 1d12 + Strength when attacking with your jaws. You can only replace an unarmed strike with a jaw attack as a part of the attack action once per turn.



**Improved Saves.** You can choose to replace your bonus to any number of saving throws with the saving throw bonus of your zoan creature if it is higher than yours for the duration of the hybrid form. Additionally, you can also do this with the creature's initiative bonus.

**Toxic Glands.** If your zoan creature can produce poison or venom, you learn the Poison Spray cantrip for the duration of your hybrid form. Additionally, you gain the ability to poison your victims. You can choose to lace one weapon attack or unarmed strike with poison on your turn. If the attack hits a target, that creature is poisoned until the end of their next turn.






CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

\page

**Quills or Spines.** If your zoan creature has defensive quills, spines, or other sharp protrusions on its body, you can gain this feature. When a creature hits you with a melee attack within 5 feet, they take piercing damage equal to half your character level.

**Size Change.** If your zoan creature is at least one size larger or smaller than you, you can also become a size larger or smaller for the duration of your hybrid form. Treat this as the Enlarge Reduce spell, except no concentration or components are required. 

**Pouncing Strike.** If your zoan animal has the pounce feature or something similar, you can use this ability for the duration of your hybrid form. If you move at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with an unarmed strike on the same turn, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, you can make one unarmed strike against it as a bonus Action. For this, the DC is 8 + your Proficiency bonus + Strength modifier. You can only knock a creature prone using this feature once per turn.

**Charging Horns or Hooves.** If your zoan animal has horns, hooves, or a stomp attack, you also grow horns or hooves for the duration of your hybrid form. You can now choose to deal either piercing or bludgeoning for your unarmed strikes, which you are now proficient with, and your unarmed strike damage dice becomes at least 1d6 + Strength when attacking with your horns or hooves. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with an unarmed strike, the damage dice is doubled for the attack if you are within 5 feet of the target while attacking. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be shoved 5 feet away from you. For this, the DC is 8 + your Proficiency bonus + Strength modifier. You can only shove a creature and deal extra damage using this feature once per turn.

**Hopping.** If your zoan creature has the ability to leap or hop great distances, your Long Jump is up to 25 feet and your High Jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start for the duration of your hybrid form.

**Sticky Feet.** If your zoan creature has sticky hands or feet, you also gain sticky hands and feet for the duration of your hybrid form. While you are sticky this way, you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed, you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down or on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, you can ignore movememnt restrictions caused by sticky surfaces, such as webbing.

**Extra Appendages.** If your zoan creature is an insectoid with six to eight appendages, you also gain the same number of appendages, for the duration of your hybrid form. While you cannot efficiently wield weapons with these appendages, you may use them to hold smaller items such as potions and trinkets. Additionally, you have advantage on grapple checks using these new appendages.

**Aerial Combat.** If your zoan animal has wings or some other means of flight, you can deliver special attacks with your beak, talons, or other sharp bodily weapons while flying in your hybrid form. You can now choose to deal either piercing or slashing for your unarmed strikes, which you are now proficient with, and your unarmed strike damage dice becomes at least 1d6 + Strength. If you dive at least 30 feet toward a target while flying and then hit it with an unarmed strike, the damage dice is doubled for the attack if you are within 5 feet of the target while attacking. Additionally, even if you didn't hit, the target cannot make opportunity attacks against you when you fly out of its reach for the rest of your turn.

**Constriction.** If your zoan creature has the ability to constrict or crush a creature with immense force while grappling it (e.g. constrictor snake), you now have the ability to wrap tightly around enemies in a similar fashion. When you make a successful grapple attempt against a creature, the creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and becomes restrained for the duration it is grappled.

**Bioluminescence.** If your creature uses bioluminescence (e.g. firefly), you shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. You can use an action to expand or reduce this radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.

**Venemous Stinger or Fangs.** If your zoan creature has a stinger, fangs, or any other form of natural poisonous weapon, you also gain that feature on your body for the duration of your hybrid form. You can now choose to deal piercing damage for your unarmed strikes, which you are now proficient with, and your unarmed strike damage dice becomes at least 1d6 + Strength when attacking with your stinger or fangs. Additionally, if you hit a creature with your stinger or fangs, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d4 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For this, the DC is 8 + your Proficiency bonus + Constitution modifier. You can only replace an unarmed strike with a stinger or fang attack as a part of the attack action once per turn.

**Rampaging.** If your zoan creature is a carnivorous hunter, you will begin to rampage as you hunt your targets. If you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points with a melee Attack on your turn, you can take a bonus Action to move up to half its speed and make a melee Attack.

**Resilient.** Your hybrid form makes you particularly durable. If you take 10 damage or less that would reduce you to 0 hit points while in your hybrid form, you can choose to be reduced to 1 hit point instead. You can only use this feature once per hybrid transformation.

**Strong Footing.** If your zoan creature is a quadripedal land animal, you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock you prone.


CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

```
```

**Fleet Footed.** If your zoan creature has a walking speed that is higher than your base walking speed, your base walking speed increases to that amount for the duration of your hybrid form.

**Special Action.** If your zoan creature has a special action with a recharge (e.g. Giant Spider's Web, Red Dragon's Fire Breath, etc.), you can now use this ability in your hybrid form as an action. Once you use this option, you cannot use it again in your hybrid form until you complete a long rest.

**Ancient Fury (Ancient or Mythical Zoan only)**. Your zoan powers provide you with the ability to deliver crushing attacks in your hybrid form, making your melee attacks using your hyrid options (e.g. Razor Claws, Powerful Jaws, etc.) deal one extra die of its damage when you hit with them.

**Mighty Constitution (Ancient or Mythical Zoan only)**. Your zoan powers grant you immense fortitude, giving you a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your character level when you enter your hybrid form. These temporary hit points last until you are no longer in your hybrid form. You cannot gain the benefits of this option again until you complete a long rest.

**Supreme Natural Armor (Ancient or Mythical Zoan only).** If your zoan creature has an AC of higher than 16, your AC can’t be less than your zoan creature's AC, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing, for the duration of your hybrid form.


**Mythical Skill (Mythical Zoan only).** If your mythical zoan creature has special skills (e.g. Hydra's Multiple Heads, Phoenix's Fire Form, etc.) you gain that skill as a feature in your hybrid form. You cannot gain Legendary Resistance, Lair Actions, or Legendary Actions using this feature.

You can choose the Mystical Skill option multiple times when you enter your hybrid form to gain multiple special features this way, counting it as an additional option.

**Mythical Attack (Mythical Zoan only).** You gain the ability to use any weapon attack actions your mythical zoan creature can use as an attack action during its turn (e.g. Hydra's Bite attack and Multiattack) while in your hybrid form. However, you must use your modifiers and proficiency bonus for these attacks. You cannot gain Legendary Resistance, Lair Actions, or Legendary Actions using this feature.

### Awakening

Upon the awakening of your Zoan Devil Fruit power, when you enter your Hybrid Form, you can temporarily enter your Awakened State, which lasts for 1 minute.

While your Awakened State is active, your hit point maximum and hit points increase by 50, your weapon attacks and unarmed strike attacks deal extra damage of their primary damage type equal to your character level, and you are able to select an additional hybrid form option. Furthermore, at the start of each of your turns for the duration of this state, you regain hit points equivalent to your character level + your Constitution modifier.

Should the duration of your Awakened State expire, you hold the option to extend its span for an additional minute, at the cost of incurring a level of exhaustion. If needed, you can further extend this state by enduring an extra level of exhaustion for each additional minute. These levels of exhaustion can only be removed by completing a long rest.

Once your Awakened State ends, it can't be activated again for another 24 hours.

### Custom Zoan Creature Creation

When rolling for a random zoan type devil fruit, it is possible to roll a zoan creature that does not have a statblock available in official D&D books that the DM can provide you with. If this is the case, the DM can follow this guide to create a custom creature stat block following the custom monster creation rules starting on page 273 in the standard *D&D Dungeon Master's Guide*. Make sure to stay within the CR range for the zoan creature, which is determined by the rarity of the devil fruit. If there is a creature you can use as your zoan creature but it happens to be outside of your devil fruit's CR range, have your DM lower its stats to reflect the maximum CR of its CR range.

Alternatively, an easier way to do this is to find a similar creature with an official stat block and with an appropriate CR, then use that stat block as a template or guide. Here are some examples of devil fruits that might not have an official creature stat block, but take inspiration from previously existing statblocks.

## Designing a Logia Devil Fruit Sheet

Logia Devil Fruits are one of the three types of devil fruit classifications, allowing their users to turn transform their body into a natural element, while also being able to create and control it. Logia type devil fruit powers are normally considered the rarest and strongest of the three types.

### Logia Subtypes
**Solid Logias**, **Liquid Logias**, and **Gaseous Logias** are the three subtypes of logia devil fruits that defines a logia user's abilities and what element and state of matter they can transform into or use with their powers. All three of these subtypes are roughly equal in power, though some logia elements can be weaker than others on average.

#### Type: Solid Logia User

Solid logia devil fruit powers allow their users to transform themselves into a solid element, create solid objects out of that element, and transform materials into that element. For example, the Hie Hie no Mi, or ice logia power, allows its user to transform into ice that can break apart or reform without inflicting damage on the user. Additionally, the user can freeze just about any object, and can create weapons or structures out of ice. Other elements that solid logia fruits might specifically use are materials such as wood, stone, brick, glass, salt, and metal.

#### Type: Liquid Logia User

Liquid logia devil fruit powers allow their users to transform themselves into a liquid element, create liquid pools, waves, or fluid objects out of that element, and break down materials by using that element. For example, the Magu Magu no Mi, or magma logia power, allows it user to transform into magma that can morph into a puddle or mold into any fluid shape to avoid attacks. Additionally, the user can use the magma to melt down objects, create hell hounds out of magma, or produce volcanic eruptions. Other elements that liquid logia fruits might specifically use are materials such as mud, syrup, gasoline, blood, milk, wine, or a liquid chemical. Liquid fresh water or sea water cannot be used as a logia element.

#### Type: Gaseous Logia User

Gaseous logia devil fruit powers allow their users to transform themselves into a type of gas, plasma, or free-moving particle, and can use this element to create clouds, missiles, beams, or produce other various effects. For example, the Pika Pika no Mi, or light logia power, allows its user to disperse into light particles and reform at the speed of light. Additionally, the user can create explosive light beams, project themselves as a beam of light to move at unmatched speeds, and create various weapons out of light. Other elements that gaseous logia fruits might specifically use are wind, smoke, sand, helium, xenon, neon, propane, poison gas, fire, snow, and lightning.

```
```
#### Type: Darkness Logia User

The Yami Yami no Mi, or darkness logia, is such a unique and powerful devil fruit that it deserves its own subcategory. It can be considered one of the strongest, if not the strongest, devil fruit. Unlike other logias, its user cannot disperse into darkness or avoid physical attacks. However, it gives the user complete control over darkness that they can produce, which can consume any material or element. The specific stats and abilities of this power will be listed under "More Exmple Logia Sheets".

### Logia Damage Type, Resistances, and Immunities

Logia users are provided with some of the greatest protection, agility, and damage out of all devil fruit types. Being able to disperse into their element, they can avoid just about any attack. And because they can transform into their element at any time, they can consistently deal a damage type based on their element.

#### Devil Fruit Feature: Logia Resistances and Immunities

Logia devil fruit users will almost immediately notice that they are immune to certain types of elemental damage and conditions, as their body composition is changed into their element. Additionally, all logia fruits aside from the Yami Yami no Mi, or darkness logia fruit, grant its user complete immunity to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

For example, an ice logia devil fruit will make its user immune to all physical damage and cold damage, as well as any conditions applied from cold environments or cold-based attacks. Working with your DM, decide which of the following features apply to you based on your devil fruit's power and nature.

#### Devil Fruit Feature: Logia Attacks
You can choose to deal a specific type of damage by replacing the damage type of your attacks and devil fruit spells with one that matches your power. If your devil fruit does not have a special elemental damage type to pick from, choose between bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing (based on how you use your powers).

For example, the Pika Pika no Mi, or light logia power, will allow its user to deal radiant damage with any spell, ranged, or melee attack made using its devil fruit powers. An ice logia power will grant its user the ability to use cold damage, a magma logia power will grant its user the ability to use fire damage, etc. This would also mean if you cast a spell using your devil fruit ability, such as fireball, you will replace the fire damage with the damage type corresponding to your devil fruit's nature (such as radiant damage for a Pika Pika no Mi user).



CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

\page

### Logia Basic Skills

Every logia type devil fruit will have at least one ability or attack that can be used innately so long as the devil fruit user is not incapacitated or exposed to water or seastone. Elemental cantrips such as Firebolt work well for this purpose, as they can be used infinitely for little to no cost.

#### Logia Elemental Form

As a logia user, you can channel your devil fruit powers through your body to enter an elemental form, fully altering your body composition to match your logia material. You can enter this form as an action on your turn.

While in your elemental form, unless you are using the Yami Yami no Mi devil fruit, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a +2 bonus to AC.
* You have advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws.
* You can move through the space of another creature, and it doesn't count as difficult terrain. If you end your turn in another creature's space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied space you occupied, and you take 1d8 force damage.
* You choose which equipment you are holding transforms into your element and travels with you normally. Worn equipment functions as usual, but benefits from your resistances and immunities and attacks that normally phase through you will also phase through your equipment as if it is a part of your body.

Your elemental form lasts for a number of minutes equal to half your character level (rounded up). It ends early if you are knocked unconscious, become incapacitated by seastone or water or end it as a bonus action.

You can enter this form a number of times equal to your Proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.

Depending on your logia subtype, you also transform into a mist, pool, or mass of solid material matching your element for the duration of the your elemental form, gaining these additional abilities:

**Solid Form.** As a bonus action on your turn, shattering into solid pieces of your logia element and reforming, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

**Liquid Form.** You can spend 5 feet to transform into your liquid element and move into the small cracks of a solid surface and reform in a puddle, reappearing on a spot on the same surface up to 30 feet away from you that you dont need to be able to see. You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration. 

**Gaseous Form.** Still in the shape of your original form, you become a misty cloud of particles made of your element for the duration, making your only method of movement a flying speed equal to your movement speed. You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks. You remain hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise Incapacitated, unless by seastone or water. 





```
```

> ##### Design Tips
> Logia powers can be viewed as paramecia powers with far greater abilities, immunities, and spells. The example logia sheets provided here and later will show designs for every Logia Devil Fruit listed under "Devil Fruit Generation" earlier in this chapter. If you wish to create custom Logia devil fruits based on different elements, use these sheets as a template.





The example sheet below shows an early design idea for the Moku Moku no Mi using logia immunities and resistances as well as basic skills.


##### Example: Moku Moku no Mi (Smoke)
*Devil Fruit, Very Rare*

**Type.** Gaseous Logia

	
**Fruit appearance.** Puffy white melon with cloud-like swirls.
	
**Description.** Allows its user to create, control, and transform into smoke at will.
	
**Sea Weakness.** You are weak to water and seastone.

**Logia Immunity.** You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, as physical objects pass through your smoke body. Additionally, you can see normally through smoke, cloud, and fog-like effects that cause an area to become lightly or heavily obscured.
	
**Elemental Form.** You can use the "Logia Elemental Form" feature listed under "Designing a Logia Devil Fruit Sheet".
	
**White Blow.** Your limbs extend, connected by smoke. You can use the Mage Hand cantrip. Additionally, when you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 30 feet greater than normal.













CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

### Logia Spells, Skills and Awakening

Similar to creating a paramecia devil fruit power, designing and deciding which spells and skills which can be used with a devil fruit can be tricky at first. Hopefully, after following these steps, choosing paramecia devil fruit spells will become a little more intuitive.

Also be sure to refer back to "Designing a Devil Fruit Sheet with Steps" under step 4 for more examples and an explanation on devil fruit charges and which spell levels to choose from.

To decide which spells to choose from, make sure you keep their spell level beneath the "highest spell level" equal to or lower than the number decided by the devil fruit's rarity. The spell you choose can be from any 5e class spell list. Next, select at least 1 or more spells within that range and modify them as needed. Remember to stick to the rules of paramecia subtypes in order to decide what these spells will be allowed to target, such as "self only" for body enhancers.

A good example for this might be for a Mera Mera no Mi (fire) logia devil fruit user to be able to cast Burning Hands (1 charge) and Fireball (3 charges), representing how its user can use skills involving bursts of fire. Additionally, an awakening ability might be a much higher level spell than can be used once per day, even bypassing the spell level limit for that devil fruit.

Here is another more in-depth example below still using the Moku Moku no Mi, a very rare type devil fruit, as a template to show which type of spells and awakening ability might be appropriate to use.



**Spells (Smoke Plumes).** This devil fruit power has 13 charges. Using your ability to produce smoke, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Fog Cloud (1 charge), Misty Step (2 charges), Gaseous Form (3 charges), Stinking Cloud (3 charges), Cloudkill (5 charges), Investiture of Wind (6 charges), Wind Walk (6 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.
	
**Awakening (Explosive Plume).** Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Incendiary Cloud without expending any charges or material components. You can’t use this feature again for another 24 hours.
	


> ##### Design Tips
> There are a wide variety of official D&D resources and books, including the official D&D Dungeon Master's Guide, that provide a wide variety of spells you can use for the purpose of devil fruit creation. Keep logia spells in line with their logia element (e.g. Mera Mera no Mi logia can cast burning hands, fireball, etc.). A very rare logia should at the very least on par with a 7th-level or higher spell, while a legendary logia awakening should be on par with a 9th-level spell. If you are having trouble finding a fitting spell for a certain logia element, feel free to alter existing spells to fit the devil fruit's abilities.





CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

## Devil Fruit Advancement and Awakening

Similar to Haki, a character can advance their devil fruit abilities over time to grow stronger. If a party or indiviudal is rewarded with "Spirit Surge" from an event, they might choose to receive a "Devil Fruit Advancement" feature instead of a "Haki Advancement" feature (only one type of advancement feature can be chosen each time). You can only take a feature listed here once.

### Improved Basic Ability
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Uncommon*

**Prerequisite:** Paramecia or Logia Type

You have learned how to better use your Devil Fruit powers on a basic level.

With the help and approval of your DM, you may choose one Cantrip and one 1st-Level Spell from any class spell list that fits the nature of your Devil Fruit power.

You learn and use the chosen Cantrip, without expending material components, as a part of your basic Devil Fruit powers. You can also use the chosen spell as part of your Devil Fruit spells by spending 1 Devil Fruit charge to use it, no material components required.

### Devil's Gift
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Uncommon*

Through your Devil Fruit power, you notice large improvements in your attributes, skills, or abilities.

You can select and use a player Feat (chapter 6) that fits the nature of your Devil Fruit, with the approval of your DM.

### Faster Form
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Uncommon*

**Prerequisite:** Zoan or Logia Type

Through practicing transforming with your Devil Fruit, you now take up less time chainging into your form.

Now, instead of using an action to activate your Zoan Hybrid or Logia Elemental Form, you only need to use a Bonus Action on your turn.

### Resistance Shatter
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Uncommon*

**Prerequisite:** Paramecia or Logia Type

You have learned to focus your Devil Fruit powers into higher concentrations of magic energy, overcoming any resistances a creature might naturally have.

Choose a damage type other than force you deal with your Devil Fruit spells or abilities. You now ignore resistances to that damage type when using Spells or Abilities from your Devil Fruit, unless the resistance is granted by Haki.

```
```



### Greater Hybrid
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Uncommon*

**Prerequisite:** Zoan Type

Your knowledge of your Zoan Hybrid form grows to allow you to gain multiple new mutations.

When you enter your hybrid form, you can select one additional Hybrid Form Option you can use for the duration of your hybrid form.

### Power Potency
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Uncommon*

By increasing the effectiveness of your Devil Fruit powers on others, you gain a +1 bonus to your Devil Fruit save DC and Devil Fruit Attack modifier.

If the Spirit Surge Event has a rarity higher than Uncommon, use these bonuses:

**Rare.** The bonus increases to +2 instead.

**Very Rare.** The bonus increases to +3 instead.

**Legendary.** The bonus increases to +4 instead.



### Devil Recharge
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Paramecia or Logia Type

You now recover Devil Fruit charges at a faster rate when resting.

When you complete a short rest, you can expend Hit Dice to regain a number of Devil Fruit charges equal to Hit Dice spent.

### Greater Beast Shape
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Zoan Type

Your mastery over your Zoan Creature form is greatly improved.

You now only need to spend a bonus action to enter your zoan Beast Shape, instead of an action. Additionally, while you are transformed by your Beast Shape, you can spend a bonus action to regain hit points equal to your zoan creature's Hit Dice. You can regain hit points this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a long rest.

### Devil's Determination
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Rare*

You are now far more resistant to having your Devil Fruit weakness exploited.

You now have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid breaking Concentration on Devil Fruit spells or being incapacitated by seastone.



CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

\page

### Greater Resistance
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Paramecia or Logia Type

By improving the strength of your Devil Fruit properties or elemental nature, you can defend against a greater range of attack types.

With the help and approval of your DM, choose a type of damage that isn't force, you have now adapted to resist that damage type using your Devil Fruit powers. Alternatively, you may choose one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. You are now immune to that condition instead.

### Beast's Resilience
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Zoan Type

If you are subjected to an effect that would end your Beast Shape, such as Seastone or Haki, you can use a reaction to remain in your form instead of reverting. If the effect would apply to you for an extended duration, you resist reverting until the end of your next turn. You cannot use this reaction again until you complete a Long Rest.

Additionally, when any type of damage other than force dealt to your Beast Shape would carry over into your base form when you revert, the amount that carries over to your base form becomes 0.

### Greater Beast Evolution
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Zoan Type

Your knowledge of your Zoan Hybrid form further expands, allowing you to incorporate even more features of your Beast Shape into your Hybrid Form.

Now, when you enter your Hybrid Form, you can choose two additional Hybrid Form Options you can use for the duration of your Hybrid Form.

### Devil's Combo
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Paramecia or Logia Type

When you use your action to cast a spell with your devil fruit, you may make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Greater Force
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Zoan Type

Your strength and speed in your beast form have reached their pinnacle.

While in your beast form, you gain a +2 bonus to Strength and Dexterity. This bonus also applies to your hybrid form, if you have one.

### Demonic Burst
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Paramecia or Logia Type

Harnessing your Devil Fruit powers, you can amplify the force of your attacks.

Once per turn, when you hit with an attack using a Devil Fruit spell or ability, you can deal an extra 2d6 damage of the same type dealt by the attack to the target.

### Devil Fruit Evolution
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Very Rare*

**Prerequisite:** Uncommon or Rare devil fruit

By harnessing your Devil Fruit's capabilities to their full extent, you elevate your power to heights previously uncharted.

Upon taking this advancement, the rarity of your Devil Fruit power is increased by one category for you. Thus, an uncommon fruit becomes rare and a rare fruit becomes very rare. This advancement cannot be applied to a fruit that is already of Very Rare or Legendary rarity.

The elevation in your Devil Fruit's rarity subsequently boosts the range of its powers. Ask your DM to enhance your existing Devil Fruit sheet or craft a new one to accurately represent the increased rarity. The DM must refer to the "Designing a Devil Fruit Sheet with Steps" section from an earlier chapter for guidance.

When augmenting a Devil Fruit's power according to its new rarity, a few key adjustments should be made. First, the DC for all spells and effects should be increased by one. In addition, the daily maximum of expendable Devil Fruit charges should also be raised. The highest level of spell the fruit can cast should be adjusted. For Zoan type fruits, both the beast shape's Challenge Rating (CR) range and the number of hybrid form features should be increased. However, the awakening ability might not necessarily change. Further modifications to more accurately represent the elevated rarity of the Devil Fruit power should be made at the discretion of the DM.

If the Spirit Surge Event has a rarity higher than Very Rare, use these bonuses:

**Legendary.** You can evolve a Very Rare devil fruit to legendary.



### Greater Devil Fruit Spells
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Legendary*

**Prerequisite:** Paramecia or Logia Type

You have learned how to better use your Devil Fruit powers on an advanced level.

With the help and approval of your DM, you may choose one Spell of any level less than or equal to the spell level maximum of your Devil Fruit's rarity from any class spell list that fits the nature of your Devil Fruit power.

You use the chosen spell as part of your Devil Fruit spells by spending a number of Devil Fruit charges equal to the spell level to use it, no material components required.

### Form Mastery
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Legendary*

**Prerequisite:** Zoan or Logia Type

You have now mastered your devil fruit form to such a degree that you can transform as many times as you'd like.

You can now enter your Zoan Hybrid form or Logia Elemental form without a max duration, or until you end it as a bonus action. These forms still end if you fall unconscious or come into contact with seastone.





CHAPTER 7 | DEVIL FRUITS & HAKI

### Devil Fruit Awakening
*Devil Fruit Advancement, Legendary*

You've now unlocked the ultimate stage of your Devil Fruit power, granting you the ability to surpass the boundaries of your usual capabilities.

Your "Awakening" ability, as listed on your Devil Fruit sheet, is now accessible to you. If you're a Logia or Paramecia user, refer to the details on your Devil Fruit sheet; if you're a Zoan type, consult the "Designing a Zoan Devil Fruit Sheet" section earlier in this chapter for more details on your awakening.

Furthermore, if activating your Awakening ability requires you to expend an action, you may enter an Awakened state, which lasts for 1 minute. If your specific Awakening doesn't require spending an action for activation, you must still spend an action to enter your Awakened state.

While in this Awakened state, your Devil Fruit power grants you the following features for the duration:

* **Paramecia.** As a Paramecia user, you now possess the ability to control and shape your environment with the properties of your devil fruit. You may spend an action to cast one of the following spells, no concentration required, without needing any material components: Animate Objects, Telekinesis, Transmute Rock, or Move Earth. Once you have cast one of these spells in this manner, you are unable to cast another using this feature until you reenter your Awakening state. When your Awakening concludes, the effects of the chosen spell also end.

* **Logia.** As a Logia user, your Awakening powers provide you with the ability to dramatically reshape the terrain and environment in your vicinity. When you enter your Awakening state, you can alter the terrain within an area of up to 1 mile around you, in a manner similar to casting the Mirage Arcane spell. However, the chosen terrain must correspond with the nature of your Logia power. In contrast to Mirage Arcane, the changed terrain is not an illusion; it is genuine and maintains its transformed form even after your Awakening state has ended. During your Awakened state, you can spend an action to trigger the eruption of a vertical column of elemental energy from any piece of terrain you have transformed. This causes a 40-foot-high cylinder with a 10-foot radius, centered on a point you can see, to burst forth. Every creature within this cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature talkes 8d6 damage of your Logia power's type, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the spell's duration concludes, the terrain reverts back to its previous form. You are unable to use this feature again until you enter your Awakening state again.

Should the duration of your Awakened State expire, you hold the option to extend its span for an additional minute, at the cost of incurring a level of exhaustion. If needed, you can further extend this state by enduring an extra level of exhaustion for each additional minute. These levels of exhaustion can only be removed by completing a long rest. Once your Awakened state ends, you cannot use it again for another 24 hours.

# Chapter 8: Spell Lists
This list provides all of the different spells which are used as Natural Abilities, Inventions, Tactics, or Powers listed in the various classes throughout Chapter 3. Some spells have not been omitted from these lists so as to better fit the theme of a One Piece setting. These spells are found in standard Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition and all of its expansions and suppplement books. Be sure to look up any spells that aren't in the standard 5e PHB to see which expansion book they're in.

It is important to take some artistic liberties in justifying the use of these spells in each class. For example, if a Tinkerer casts fireball, the DM or player can describe it as the character shooting an explosion of flames out of their gadget using some form of sci-fi power source.

***Legend.*** Spells marked with ^ are custom spells unique to this system, and are shown later in this chapter under "Custom Spells".

CHAPTER 8 | SPELL LISTS

## Custom Spells

This list of spells is meant to exist within the world of One Piece, although you are free to borrow from it if you wish to bring some of these spells to other systems. Many of these spells relate to mechanics within the campaign setting and rules. Since this spell list is purely Homebrew, a Dungeon Master may decide to not allow these spells in their game. These spells may be used by classes with spell lists including these spells, or can be included in Devil Fruit sheets as usable powers.

### Level 3 Spells

#### Slime Wave

*3rd level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of slime)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** Chemist, Tinkerer

You conjure up a wave of slime that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. The slime then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 30 feet of it, and then it vanishes.

#### Soap Bubble

*3rd level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bar of soap)

**Duration:** 1 Hour

**Classes:** Chemist, Hybrid, Marksman, Tinkerer

You envelop up to five chosen creatures within range in bubbles formed from a special soap. Creatures within these soap bubbles gain a swimming speed of 30 feet, the ability to breathe underwater, and an additional 5 temporary hit points for the duration of the spell. The soap bubble is attached to the target creature and moves with it. Despite gaining underwater breathing from the bubble, creatures maintain their usual means of respiration. If a creature encapsulated in a soap bubble is underwater, it is not considered submerged or in direct contact with the water as long as the bubble remains intact. Should a creature within a soap bubble lose all its temporary hit points provided by this spell, the bubble bursts, stripping the creature of its benefits.

```
```



#### Wall of Goo

*3rd level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of goo)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

**Classes:** Chemist, Hybrid, Tinkerer

You conjure up a wall of transparent goo on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall’s space is difficult terrain.

Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall’s goo doesn’t fill it.






### Level 4 Spells

#### Swamp Sphere

*4th level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of swamp material)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minutes

**Classes:** Chemist, Hybrid, Tinkerer

You conjure up a sphere of swamp mud with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell’s duration.

Any creature in the sphere’s space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature’s choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the mud. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.

As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.

When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The wmud then vanishes.

### Level 5 Spells

#### Great Heaven Splitter

*5th level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon worth at least ฿1,000)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

**Classes:** Devilforged, Marksman, Skald, Tinkerer

You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then unleash a devastating slash of energy. The energy slash forms a line 150 feet long and 20 feet high traveling in a direction you choose coming from you. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d6 slashing damage and 5d6 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.




### Level 8 Spells

#### Poison Giant: Hell's Judgement

*8th level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Classes:** Chemist, Priest, Tinkerer

You create a gargantuan poison demon around you, forming a 20-foot radius sphere of poison centered on you which moves with you and is considered difficult terrain. If a creature ends its turn within this area around you, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 7d6 poison or acid damage (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

During each of your turns while the spell is active, you may spend an action to allow the poison demon to make two attacks against any creature within 30 feet of you. These attacks count as melee spell attacks, and deal 4d12 poison or acid damage (your choice) on a hit.

Any creature that takes poison or acid damage from this spell is poisoned until the end of its next turn. 


#### Slime Tsunami

*8th level conjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minutes

**Classes:** Chemist, Hybrid, Tinkerer

A wall of slime springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The wall lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

At the start of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. At the end of the turn, the wall’s height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends.

A creature caught in the wall can move by moving through the slime. The wall counts as difficult terrain. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can’t move. A creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground.






### Level 9 Spells

#### Locate Devil Fruit Power

*9th level divination*

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Self

**Target** Self

**Components:** V S M (A ripe fruit)

**Duration:** Up to 8 hours

**Classes:** Chemist, Devilforged, Priest, Tinkerer

Give a basic description of any Devil Fruit you have seen before, or a Devil Fruit name, category, or power that might reasonably exist. For example, describing a Logia Devil Fruit power which allows you to transform into flames might closest resemble a description of the Mera Mera no Mi. Using a Devil Fruit Book to list the exact name of a Devil Fruit will make this process more precise, since it should list the names and powers of every known Devil Fruit power. Once the Devil Fruit power is described or named, you sense the Devil Fruit's location. If there is no existing Devil Fruit which quite matches your description or if your requirements are too vague, the DM may randomly choose a Devil Fruit closest to your description instead. 

You know the exact location of the chosen Devil Fruit for the duration of the spell. You can precisely point to it on any map and know the exact routes to take to find it, unless it is located in uncharted territory, in which case you will only have a sense of the general direction it is in. If the Devil Fruit has been consumed by a creature or object, you know the exact location of that creature or object for the duration of the spell instead (as if using Locate Creature or Locate Object, without any of the distance limitations).

#### Ice Age

*9th level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1 mile

**Components:** V, S 

**Duration:** 8 hours

**Classes:** Chemist, Tinkerer

You freeze over every body of water and any freezable liquid within range. Any creature that is within 60 feet of you or touching at least a 5-foot cube of liquid that is being frozen by this spell within range must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 20d8 cold damage and becomes restrained on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and isn't restrained on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws. 

Any water or liquid frozen by this spell becomes solid ice, and each 5-foot square of it has AC 12 and 20 hit points, and is vulnerable to fire damage. Once the ice melts or gets destroyed, or the duration of the spell ends, the water or liquid it was made of returns to its regular state. A creature restrained by this spell must break every 5-foot block of ice it is inside of in order to become unrestrained, or succeed on a Constitution saving throw made at the end of each of its turns to slip out of the segments of ice it is trapped in and move 5 feet to an empty space.





#### Flame Emperor

*9th level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1,000 ft

**Components:** V, S, M (a perfect ball of coal)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Classes:** Hybrid, Tinkerer, Priest

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of concentrated flames center on a point you can see within range. The sphere is considered rough terrain. For the spell's duration, any flammable substance within 100 feet of the sphere is ignited if it isn't being worn or carried.

If a creature ends its turn within the sphere, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 60 feet in any direction up to 1,000 feet away from you. Once you hit a creature with the sphere, you can only move it up to half its remaining distance. Any creatures hit while you move the sphere this way must make the saving throw against the sphere's damage. 

You can detonate this sphere as a bonus action on your turn, hitting every creature within 100 feet of the sphere with the explosion. Any creature in this range must make a Dexteirty saving throw. Creatures take 20d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you detonate the sphere this way, the spell ends.

```
```



#### Island Shaking

*9th level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1 mile

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

**Classes:** Hybrid, Priest

You are able to pull apart fault lines in the earth, twisting and turning the ground beneath you in many different directions. For the duration of this spell, all terrain connected to the ground within range becomes difficult terrain. 

When you first cast this spell, you can choose a 100-foot-radius circle you can see within range to violently thrust upward out of the ground. Each creature standing in the radius must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 20d6 bludgeoning damage and is launched 100 feet into the air, or half as much and is knocked prone while holding on to the ground beneath it instead on a successful one. Additionally, any structure and object that isn't being carried or worn in contact with the ground within this radius takes 50 bludgeoning damage.

You can repeat this action by spending an action once per turn on each subsequent turn to do so while the spell is active.
