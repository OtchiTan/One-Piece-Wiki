<p>First off, thank you so much for checking out this book! This book wouldn't have been possible without the backing and assistance from our amazing Discord community!

<p>TABLE OF CONTENTS </p>
<p>\page</p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h3 id="what-is-this-book">What is this book?</h3>
<p>This is a Devil Fruit Encyclopedia that can be used for running your own D&amp;D campaign using the One Piece Setting. For more rules for running such a campaign, consider checking out the companion books <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/ItlMSW6ztZTm">Dungeons and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook</a> and <a href="https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/sK-UDzk7x8U_">Dungeons and Devil Fruits Dungeon Master's Guide</a>. When combined with the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB, this book offers a deeper understanding of the principles that shape these powers within the 5th Edition D&amp;D landscape.</p>
<p>Within these pages, you'll discover an extensive collection of Devil Fruits, each presented with magic item-inspired stat blocks. While many are drawn directly from the series, others are entirely original or adapted for D&amp;D 5th Edition. For those who wish to introduce an element of randomness to finding these fruits, <strong>Chapter 7</strong> of the Dungeons and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook features tables allowing for random Devil Fruit generation. Alternatively, DMs can personally handpick specific Devil Fruits to enhance the abilities of players or enemies.</p>
<h3 id="severe-power-discrepancies-with-devil-fruits">Severe power discrepancies with Devil Fruits?</h3>
<p>It's possible that, with sheer randomness, players may end up with an exceptionally powerful or underwhelming Devil Fruit. This inherent unpredictability is what renders the Devil Fruits so interesting, yet risky. If you believe this randomness detracts from the enjoyment or balance of your game, consider personally choosing the fruits that align with your own campaign's balance and design philosophy. You're also encouraged to adjust any Devil Fruit sheets to better match your group's preferences.</p>
<p>Should you wish, consider introducing scaled versions of the powers, especially for the rarer Devil Fruits. This scaling option depends on player level or progress throughout the campaign. While this approach might initially temper the excitement of certain Devil Fruits, it allows DMs to distribute more formidable Devil Fruit without destroying the game's balance early on.</p>
<p>To the right, you'll find optional Devil Fruit advancement rules based on player levels, tailored to the distinct types of Devil Fruits: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. These regulations primarily target the substantial advantages that Very Rare and Legendary Devil Fruits might grant early in a campaign. For instance, a Legendary Devil Fruit granting 17 charges and access to 9th level spells might be restricted to its 5th level spells and a maximum of 9 charges for a level 9 player, until they reach later levels in the campaign. This would NOT raise a Devil Fruit's highest spell level, maximum charges or maximum challenge rating if it has lower than the threshold on these tables, unless a player takes the Devil Fruit Evolution advancement available in the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB. Regardless of these limitations, all other abilities on the Devil Fruit sheet remain available. Such a system can add layers of progression, enriching the narrative while ensuring gameplay remains balanced.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-allow-my-players-to-view-this-book">Should I allow my players to view this book?</h3>
<p>The question of whether players should be privy to this compendium is a valid concern. Perhaps you've crafted a scenario where players uncover a book detailing all known Devil Fruits—a treasure mentioned in the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB's Underworld Markets section. Should such a situation arise, there are several paths you can take.</p>
<p>One approach is to present this Encyclopedia as is, with the caveat that the Devil Fruit abilities described can vary among users. A more restrained option is to let players see only the Devil Fruit names, classifications, appearances, and general descriptions, keeping the exact stats and precise abilities under wraps to prevent metagaming. If you're particularly wary of metagaming, consider unveiling a condensed version, showcasing a select few "known" Devil Fruits accompanied by rudimentary descriptions, without delving into specifics. The latter two alternatives are my personal recommendations, but the choice, of course, is yours.</p>
<h3 id="some-devil-fruits-arent-included-why-not">Some devil fruits aren't included! Why not?</h3>
<p>In the process of crafting this system and compendium, I chose to spotlight 240 Devil Fruits. This isn't to imply a limitation on the number of Devil Fruits in your campaigns, but rather to present a curated collection that can be seamlessly incorporated. Some Devil Fruits—either due to their recent introduction in the manga or challenges in design—didn't make the cut. At present, I don't plan on expanding this Encyclopedia. However, those seeking a wider variety of Devil Fruits can either craft their own fruits or delve into the rich reservoir of homebrewed Devil Fruits courtesy of our wonderful community over at our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/2TrWf6FH5e">Discord</a>.</p>
<h3 id="endless-possibilities">Endless Possibilities</h3>
<p>The world of Devil Fruits is vast, and this compendium doesn't seek to limit creativity, but rather ignite it. Take these sheets as starting points for your own unique concoctions. Wish to introduce a "Candy-Candy Logia Devil Fruit" into your world? Look no further than the templates provided, such as the Hie Hie no Mi, to serve as a foundation. Your imagination is the only limit.</p>
<p>In the vast oceans of adventure that D&amp;D offers, may these Devil Fruits serve as the winds to your players' sails, propelling them into stories filled with wonder, danger, and magic. Embark on this journey and let the world of One Piece meld beautifully with the realms of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p>Fair winds and following seas, Dungeon Masters.</p>

<p>\page</p>
<h1 id="uncommon-devil-fruits">Uncommon Devil Fruits</h1>
<h5 id="mini-mini-no-mi-shrinking">Mini Mini no Mi (Shrinking)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Uncommon</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Body Enhancer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A small teal blueberry with a dotted pattern resembling a shrinking spiral.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> Grants the user the ability to shrink their body to a minuscule size and return to their normal size at will. The user's strength remains the same regardless of size.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Tiny Form.</strong> As an action, you can halve your size, and your weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal, or you can return to your normal size. This reduction decreases your size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example (down to a minimum of tiny). You can use a subsequent action in your Tiny form to further halve your size by one category. Your weapons also shrink to match your new size. While these weapons are reduced, your attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage for each size category you have decreased by (this can’t reduce the damage below 1). Your tiny form lasts for 10 minutes or until you fall unconscious.</p>
<p><strong>Shrink Resistance.</strong> While shrunk, you are harder to hit. You gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws, but have disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</p>
<p><strong>Size Stealth.</strong> When shrunk, you can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured. You also have advantage on Stealth checks when in your shrunken state.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Shrinking Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 5 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Expeditious Retreat (Self; 1 charge), Misty Step (2 charges), . The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Mini Field).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Reduce, without expending any charges or material components, on any number of creatures of your choice that you can see within range of the spell (no concentration required). Creatures affected by this awakening also benefit from your Shrink Resistance and Size Stealth features. You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<h5 id="bara-bara-no-mi-dividing">Bara Bara no Mi (Dividing)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Uncommon</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Body Enhancer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> Dark red berries decorated with spiral patterns resembling separated pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> Allows the user to split and divide parts of their body into pieces and control said pieces telekinetically. However, the user's feet cannot float and must be on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Cut Immunity.</strong> You are immune to slashing damage, as your body can divide to avoid slashes from weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Divide Form.</strong> As a bonus action, you can split any part of your body into pieces and control them telekinetically. These pieces retain your original strength and dexterity. As another action, you can reassemble your body.</p>
<p><strong>Floating Limbs.</strong> When you divide your body, any part (except your feet) can float telekinetically up to 30 feet away from you. Appendages act similar to the Mage Hand cantrip. You can use these floating pieces to perform tasks, attack, or defend. Additionally, your reach for unarmed strike or melee weapons with the light property are 30 feet greater than normal when using floating limbs.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Chopping Technqiues).</strong> This devil fruit power has 5 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Chop Chop Cannon (as Catapult, using a body part; 1 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Blur (2 charges), or Chop Chop Festival (as Conjure Barrage, but you create a storm of floating limbs; 3 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Telekinetic Carnival).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Telekinesis, without expending any charges or material components, on any number of objects or creatures of your choice that you can see within range of the spell (no concentration required), with a duration of 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. Your divided body parts can be used to increase the range or control multiple objects simultaneously. Additionally, you can telekinetically control yourself (as if using Telekinesis) for the duration, even affecting your feet. You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 1 | UNCOMMON PARAMECIA</p>
<p>\page</p>
<h5 id="sube-sube-no-mi-smooth">Sube Sube no Mi (Smooth)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Uncommon</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Body Enhancer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A glossy pink strawberry with brain-like spiral patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> Makes the user's body smooth and slippery, causing most attacks to slide or slip off the user, protecting them from harm.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Slippery Resistance.</strong> You gain resistance to bludgeoning and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, as physical attacks slip off your body. Additionally, you are immune to falling prone due to slipping or tripping. </p>
<p><strong>Swift Movement.</strong> Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain. You also gain advantage on any Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks made to avoid being pushed or grappled.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Smooth Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 5 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Grease (Range: Self; 1 charge), Blur (2 charges), or Slip 'n Slide (Kinetic Jaunt; 2 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Ultra Glide).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Freedom of Movement on yourself with a 1 minute duration or until you fall unconscious, without expending any charges or material components, focusing on enhancing your agility and speed. While this spell is active, your speed doubles, you gain immunity to bludgeoning and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and you leave a 30-foot square trail of grease (like the Grease spell) on any surface beneath you at the end of your turn. You and your allies are ammune to this slippery trail, and move at twice the regular speed within the trail. You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<h5 id="toge-toge-no-mi-spikes">Toge Toge no Mi (Spikes)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Uncommon</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Body Enhancer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A rough-textured, spiky green kiwi with protruding thorns.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> Allows the user to grow and retract spikes from any part of their body, turning them into a living weapon. The spikes can be used both defensively and offensively.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Spike Immunity.</strong> You are immune to nonmagical piercing damage, as your body has adapted to the nature of spikes and sharp objects.</p>
<p><strong>Impaling Strike.</strong> As a bonus action, you can cause your next melee attack against a creature to deal an extra 1d8 piercing damage on a hit, as long spikes emerge from your attacks until the start of your next turn. If you grapple a creature, you can choose to impale them on your spikes, dealing 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns while the grapple lasts.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Spike Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 5 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Armor of Agathys (deals piercing damage; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Spike Growth (2 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Thorny Dominion).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to envelop yourself and the surrounding terrain in a 120-foot radius centered on you with menacing, fortified spikes. For 1 minute or until you fall unconscious, any creature, not including you or your allies, that moves within or enters this area takes 3d6 piercing damage every 5 feet it travels. Additionally, your skin hardens with a protective layer of spikes, granting you resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning and slashing damage and causing melee attackers to take damage equal to half of what they deal to you. You can’t use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 1 | UNCOMMON PARAMECIA</p>
<p>\page</p>
<h5 id="bane-bane-no-mi-springs">Bane Bane no Mi (Springs)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Uncommon</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Body Enhancer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A yellow banana in the shape of a swirl, with a similar black curved pattern covering it, topped with a spring-like stem.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> Allows the user to turn their limbs and body parts into springs, giving them an extended reach for attacks, greater speed, and heightened jumps. </p>

<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A turquoise fruit resembling a melon with various intricate swirl patterns and star-like designs.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This devil fruit grants the user the ability to summon a genie-like entity from their body. This powerful spirit is bound to the user's will and aids them in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Genie Manifestation.</strong> As an action, you can summon the genie from within you by rubbing your body like a lamp. A Djinni genie (stat block for Djinni is in the standard 5e Monster Manual) appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The genie lacks its Innate Spellcasting ability and Elemental Demise, and has hit points equal to your own. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 12 hours, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns into your body. </p>
<p>While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions. </p>
<p>After the djinni departs, it can’t be summoned again until the next dawn. You can only have one genie summoned at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Genie Abilities).</strong> The genie has a pool of 9 charges. It can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells without needing to expend material components: Thunderwave (1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Detect Evil and Good (1 charge), Gust of Wind (2 charges), Invisibility (2 charges), Gaseous Form (3 charges), Wind Wall (3 charges), Major Image (3 charges), or Creation (5 charges). The genie regains expended charges when it is re-summoned.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Genie Unleashed).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to enhance your genie's power, turning it into a massive, even more formidable form. The genie's hit points double, its size increases to huge, its attacks deal an extra ammount equal to your proficiency bonus, and it radiates an aura in a 20-foot radius. Enemy creatures within the aura must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or be frightened until the end of their next turn. This empowered state lasts for the duration of your Awakened state. You can't use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>

However, your mental ability scores remain the same and you can speak while in this form. You remain this way as long as you concentrate on maintaining it (as if concentrating on a spell). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. You can continue to use your Devil Fruit abilities and spells in this form, so long as they don't require concentration, but cannot use any other class or racial features or spells for the duration.</p>

In this state, you gain the benefits of your Stone Body devil fruit feature without needing to expend devil fruit charges, but can increase your size up to garganutan while polymorphed.

<h5 id="kage-kage-no-mi-shadows">Kage Kage no Mi (Shadows)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Rare</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Environment Alterer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A dark-purple, nearly black, heart-shaped fruit with spiraled patterns running from its stem to its base.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> Grants the user the ability to manipulate shadows, stealing them from living beings, and attaching them to other entities, including inanimate objects, thereby animating them.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow Thief.</strong> As an action, you can attempt to grab the shadow of a creature within 10 feet of you, so long as it has a CR of 1/8 or higher. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or have its shadow stolen. A creature can retrieve its shadow by destroying an undead or object which holds its shadow, or by placing salt in its mouth (touch; athletics or Sleight of Hand against the undead or object's Athletics or Acrobatics), or by stealing it back from you if you are holding it (touch; athletics or Sleight of Hand against your Athletics or Acrobatics). A creature missing its shadow falls victim to a vampire's Sunlight Hypersensitivity weakness (5e Monster Manual). When you successfully steal a shadow from a creature, you gain 1 Devil Fruit charge. If a creature who has had its shadow stolen dies, you lose its shadow and thereby lose 1 devil fruit charge.</p>
<p><strong>Shadow Animate.</strong> As an action, you can spend 1 devil fruit charge to animate a single medium or smaller sized dead creature or inanimate object (as if using animate dead or animate objects) by infusing it with a shadow you have stolen, except it has the same stats it would have if it were alive. A dead creature's CR must be equal to or less than 1 to be animated this way. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action (thus gaining 1 devil fruit charge as the shadow leaves its body) or it is destroyed (and the shadow returns to its host's body). If you wish to infuse a higher CR dead creature or larger object with shadows to animate it, you must spend a total number of charges equal to its CR (CR must be no greater than half your character level rounded up), or an additional charge for each size category the object is over medium, up to Huge (E.g. 2 charges for large, 3 for huge). </p>
<p><strong>Shadow Asgard.</strong> You can absorb stolen shadows into your body to become larger and more powerful. By spending 1 Devil Fruit charge, you absorb a shadow into yourself. For each shadow you absorb, you gain 10 temporary hit points (which only stacks with each additional shadow absorbed) up to a maximum of 30, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage (up to a maximum bonus of 3d4), your reach with melee weapons extends by 5 feet (up to a 15 foot total bonus), and your size increases by one (up to gargantuan). While this form is active, you have advantage on strength checks and saving throws. When you lose all temporary hit points granted by this ability, the shadows are expelled from your body and returned to its original host, and this ability ends.</p>
<p><strong>Doppelman.</strong> You can detach your own shadow and animate it as a bonus action in an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of you. This shadow is a magical, translucent, dark image of you that lasts until it is destroyed, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, until you manifest another shadow, or until you're incapacitated.</p>
<p>Your shadow has AC 14 + your proficiency bonus, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions and all damage except force and radiant damage. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses your saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as you, and it occupies its space. On your turn, you can mentally command the shadow to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If your shadow is ever more than a mile away from you at the end of your turn, it is destroyed. If your Doppelman touches water or salt, it is also destroyed.</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can teleport, magically swapping places with your shadow at a cost of 15 feet of your movement, regardless of the distance between the two of you.
When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the shadow's space. You make this choice for each attack.</p>
<p>When a creature that you can see within 5 feet of your shadow moves at least 5 feet away from it, you can use your reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if you were in the shadow's space.</p>
<p>If your Doppelman is ever destroyed or dismissed, your shadow returns to you. While your shadow is missing, you also fall victim to the vampire's Sunlight Hypersensitivity weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Shadow Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 9 maximum charges, but you start with none. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components, with the source of the spell being yourself or your Doppelman: Shadow Arms (Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Darkness (2 charges), Shadow Blade (2 charges), Shadow Bat Barrage (Conjure Barrage; 3 charges), Evard's Black Tentacles (4 charges), Night Parade (Danse Macabre or Animate Objects; 5 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges when shadows are collected from Shadow Thief.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Shadow Legion).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can pull shadows from all objects around you and use an action to conjure up to 10 Shadows (see the Monster Manual for statistics), for up to 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. The Shadows form in unoccupied spaces within 100 feet of you and obey your commands for 1 minute or until they are destroyed. You can dismiss one shadow as a free action during your turn, once per turn, and animate a dead creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target rises at the start of your next turn as a zombie that is under your command for the duration of your awakening, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability. Once you use ability, you can't use it again for another 24 hours.</p>

If the creature avoids looking into your eyes (such as by averting their gaze or closing their eyes), they have advantage on the saving throw. Once a creature saves, it is immune to the effects of your Petrifying Gaze for 24 hours.

If the target is unwilling to have its age reversed, it can make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a success, its age remains the same. This change affects the physical age only, not the creature's memories, mental maturity, or experiences. If a creature is reduced down from an adult to a child, it will have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until its age is reverted by a Greater Restoration spell or a similar effect, or if you choose to end the effect. Every creature and object that has been affected by this ability will be also be returned to its original age if you are knocked unconscious, thus ending this effect on them.

The object remains in its restored state permanently unless physically damaged again.

The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Maximum Reversal).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to cast Time Ravage, no spells slots or material components required. However, you instead reverse a creature's age to 30 days after it is born on a failed save, and its size becomes tiny. If the targeted creature is exactly 12 years old or less, it is instantly erased from existence on a failed save. Once used, you can't use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Description.</strong> This devil fruit empowers its user to create, control, and transform into straw at will. The straw crafted by this power isn't ordinary; it has the unique capability to redirect damage dealt to it, turning the tide of battle in unexpected ways.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Straw Doll.</strong> As an action, you can create a small straw voodoo doll of a willing creature you touch. If a creature is unwilling, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save or if the target is willing, you produce a tiny doll version of that creature which is linked to it, and then absorb it into your body. While you hold at least one doll in your body, any damage you are dealt can instead be redirected to a creature linked to the corresponding doll you contain. If a creature with a linked doll you contain drops to 0 hit points, its corresponding doll is destroyed. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to expel a doll linked to a creature and negate the effect of this ability on that creature. You can hold up to 10 straw voodoo dolls this way.</p>
<p><strong>Straw Monster.</strong> As an action, you can spend 4 or more devil fruit charges to use the Summon Construct spell (Clay), which summons a straw monster that fights for you. You can spend additional devil fruit charges to cast it at higher levels (1 charge per total spell level).</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Straw Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 9 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Entangle (1 charge), Spike Growth (2 charges), Straw Form (Guardian of Nature, great tree form only; 4 charges), Compulsion (only targets creatures with straw dolls and save made at disadvantage; 4 charges), Dominate Person (only a target with a straw doll and save made at disadvantage; 5 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Straw Invulnerability).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to enter an invulnerable straw form for 1 minute. You must concentrate to maintain this form as if it were a spell. During this awakening, you appear as a god-like straw being and you redirect all the damage you take, except force damage, onto the environment around you. When you are hit by an attack or damaging effect in this form, a nomagical object of your choice that isn't being held or worn within 60 feet of you takes the damage instead of you. Once used, you can't use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Rebirth.</strong> Upon dying, your soul does not pass on. Instead, after 1 minute, your soul returns to you and you resurrect at the spot of your physical body's death with half of your maximum hit points. This resurrection purges any poisons, diseases, or other conditions afflicting you. This does not work if your physical body is completely destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Spectral Form.</strong> As a bonus action, you can assume a ghostly, intangible form for up to 10 minutes. While in this form, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, though ending your movement inside an object deals 1d10 force damage to you. Attacks against you have disadvantage, and you have immunity to non-magical damage. Your physical body is temporarily separated from you while you are in this form, and is left incapacitated in the spot where you first used this ability until you return to it instantly by spending a bonus action or waiting until the end of the duration. Your spectral form and physical body share hit points.</p>
<p>In your spectral form, you can't fall and remain hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. You can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. You also can't attack or cast spells.</p>

On a failed save, the attacker takes half of the damage they would have dealt to you, as the force is bounced back to them.</p>
<p><strong>Wobble Infusion.</strong> As an action, you can touch an object or creature, making it wobble uncontrollably for up to 1 minute. Non-living objects have their functions disrupted (e.g., a locked door might wobble open, a sword might wobble making it harder to wield). Creatures affected must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC at the start of each of their turns.

Every creature except you within the area have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally, any spells cast within or into the area have a 25% chance to fail, as the wobbling reality distorts their effects.

If a pushed target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may expend additional devil fruit charges to increase the distance the creature is pushed as a part of this attack. If you do so, you push the creature back an additional 10 feet per devil fruit charge expended, up to 100 feet in total.</p>
<p><strong>Paw Cannon.</strong> You have the ability to repel the air around you, allowing you to fire paw-shaped air shockwaves. As an action, you can make a ranged spell attack against a target within 120 feet. On a hit, the creature takes 4d6 thunder damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or be knocked prone. You can spend 1 or more devil fruit charges to increase the damage of this attack, dealing an extra 1d6 damage per charge expended, up to 12d6 total thunder damage.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Repel.</strong> When targeted and hit by an attack, you can use your reaction and spend 7 devil fruit charges to attempt to repel the attack, causing the damage to become 0. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes half of the damage they would have dealt to you, as the attack is redirected back to them.</p>
<p><strong>Ursus Shock.</strong> As an action, you may spend 1 or more devil fruit charges to concentrate a large volume of air into your palms, allowing you to unleash it out as a devastating shockwave centered on a point within 120 feet that you can see. If you do so, you target each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. A creature takes 3d10 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw. A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the damage if it’s in the shockwave’s area. The shockwave's damage increases by 1d10 and it's radius increases by 5 feet for each additional devil fruit charge expended over 1, dealing up to 11d10 thunder damage and having up to a 50-foot radius in total.</p>
<p><strong>Pain Repel.</strong> As an action, you may expend 1 or more devil fruit charges to touch a creature and repel the pain from its body. If you do so, the target creature regains 1d10 hit points for every devil fruit charge spent. This ability has no effect on undead or constructs. Additionally, the repelled pain congeals and forms into a 10-foot-radius bubble in an empty space next to the target, and stores a number of pain equal to the amount healed from the target. The bubble lasts for up to 1 hour or until it pops. As an action, you may push the bubble up to 30 feet away from you by touching it. If you push the bubble into a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, and the bubble pops. The creature takes the amount of stored pain in necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong>Extended Travel Repel.</strong> As an action, you can touch a creature and spend 7 devil fruit charges to attempt to teleport it to a location by repelling it at extreme speeds. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. A willing creature automatically fails this save. On a failure, the creature is teleported to a place you are aware of, landing in a random empty space in the region of the DM's choice. If no target destination is given, the target is teleported to a random location of the DM's choosing in the direction it is pushed, at least 1 mile away. On a successful save, the creature is instead repelled 30 feet away from you, as per your Paw Push ability.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Repelling Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Misty Step (2 charges), Air Bubble (2 charges), Thunder Step (3 charges), Wind Wall (3 charges), Gravity Sinkhole (4 charges),  Destructive Wave (5 charges), Far step (5 charges), Scatter (6 charges), or Teleport (7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Extended Group Vacation).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to target up to 5 creatures within 30 feet of you, threatening to repel them at extreme speeds away from you. A target creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failure, the creature is subjected to your Extended Travel Repel feature. On a success, the creature is instead repelled up to 30 feet away from you, as per your Paw Push ability.</p>
<p>After using this feature, you cannot use it again for another 24 hours.</p>

<h5 id="kira-kira-no-mi-diamond">Kira Kira no Mi (Diamond)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Very Rare</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Body Enhancer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A shimmering blue berry with multifaceted crystalline surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This devil fruit empowers its user with the ability to transform or harden any part of their body into diamond.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Sharpened Diamond Body.</strong> As a bonus action, you can transform any part of your body into a melee weapon of your choice. This can range from turning an arm into a diamond longsword, fingers into dagger-like diamond blades, or even combining your arms or legs into a diamond greatclub. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. You can use this part of your body as a weapon attack, and you are proficient with it. You can only use one weapon active this way at a time, and can dismiss it using a bonus action.</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Skin.</strong> Your AC can’t be less than 20, regardless of what kind of armor you are wearing. By spending 1 devil fruit charge as a bonus action, you can gain a +2 bonus to your AC for up to 1 minute or until you fall unconscious (this effect doesn't stack).</p>
<p><strong>Brilliant Punk.</strong> You can spend a bonus action to bolster the next melee weapon attack you make during your turn with your diamond body. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon's damage type. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Diamond Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Thunder Step (3 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Stoneskin (Self; 4 charges), Destructive Wave (5 charges), or Tenser's Transformation (6 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Brilliant Wave).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to unleash a mighty earth shockwave affecting any creature standing on the ground within 60 feet of you. Any creature hit by the shockwave must make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 bludgeoning damage and 10d10 thunder damage, and is knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Additionally, immediately after you use this ability, the ground within 60 feet of you becomes extremely hard and diamond-like for 1 minute, and cannot be destroyed or affected by any spells or other effects for the duation. Once used, you can't use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>

<h5 id="goru-goru-no-mi-gold-manipulation">Goru Goru no Mi (Gold Manipulation)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Very Rare</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Environment Alterer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> An extremely shiny golden pear, with cloud-like spiral patterns across its surface.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This devil fruit empowers its user with the ability to manipulate and move around massive amounts of gold telekinetically.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Chrysokinesis.</strong> You can use the Telekinesis and Levitate spells at will, without expending a spell slot, charge, or material components. You can only target objects made of gold and creatures wearing or holding gold items using these spells this way.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Manipulation.</strong> As an action, you can target any gold within 60 feet of you to form up to thirteen 5-foot diameter spheres worth of affected gold, allowing you to telekinetically control the gold (as if using the Telekinesis spell). You cannot have more than thirteen of these gold spheres under you control at once. You require 100,000 gold pieces or 400 gold bars (or ฿1,000,000,000 worth of gold) to form each individual 5-foot diameter sphere this way. Once you use this action, you cannot use it again for another 24 hours. </p>
<p>Any gold being telekinetically controlled by this ability is considered liquid (but doesn't count against a Devil Fruit user's Sea Weakness) unless otherwise stated, and counts as difficult terrain when moved through in its liquid state. Creatures will suffocate inside liquid gold if they remain inside it. Any gold forcibly moved 60 feet away from you while being telekinetically controlled returns to an empty space you can see within 60 feet of you at the start of your next turn. Additionally, while the spheres are under your telekinetic control, you can spend an action to use one of the following effects on the gold during your turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Combine/Separate:</strong> You can combine the volumes of the gold spheres to form a larger mass of liquefied gold with a total volume no greater than the total volumes of your currently controlled gold, or split the mass back apart into independent 5-foot diameter spheres. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Slam:</strong> You can slam a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold into a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Armory:</strong> You can use a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold to form any weapon or armor of your choice. You are proficient with any gold weapon or armor you use, and ignore strength requirements to use it. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. The gold cannot be controlled or used while it is used as a weapon or piece of armor, unless you reform it back into a sphere a bonus action. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bind:</strong> You can use a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold to target a creature within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, or become restrained by the gold for 1 minute or until it breaks free (escape DC equal to your Devil Fruit save DC). The gold cannot be controlled or used while it restrains a creature, unless you free the creature from it as a bonus action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Animate:</strong> You use one sphere of gold to construct a solid Gold Golem (as Iron Golem; stats found in the standard 5th Edition Monster Manual). It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands. When it falls to 0 hit points or otherwise gets destroyed, so does the gold sphere used to construct it. You can only have one Gold Golem activate at a time, and once you create one you can't create anohter one for 24 hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collect:</strong> You condense the gold into tiny rings you collect, one ring per 5-foot diameter sphere of gold. You gain 1 devil fruit charge per ring collected, not exceeding 13 total charges, but can no longer affect the collected gold telepathically using your Gold Manipulation feature until you re-activate the feature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spells (Golden Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 13 maximum charges, but you start with none. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Golden Burst (as Thunderous Smite; 1 charge), Golden Arms (as Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Gold Wave (as Tidal Wave, made of liquid gold; 3 charges), Golden Tentacles (as Evard's Black Tentacles; 4 charges), Golden Hand (as Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), Golden Wall (as Wall of Stone; 5 charges), Flesh to Gold (as Flesh to Stone; 6 charges), and Golden Inferno (as Firestorm; 7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges when you use your "Collect" ability. All material created using these spells return back to the original gold value used to create the devil fruit charges to fuel it after the spell's duration ends.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Gold Splash).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily alchemically manifest gold from the environment, which you can control telepathically. When you do so, you can use this gold to cast Tsunami, with a 1 action casting time. After the Tsunami ends, the gold returns back to mundane, nonmagical materials. Once used, you can't use this action again for another 24 hours.</p>

<h5 id="mochi-mochi-no-mi-mochi">Mochi Mochi no Mi (Mochi)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Very Rare</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Special Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A creamy white fruit with a swirl pattern across its surface. It appears to have a pinched off, flattened foot toward the bottom of it.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This devil fruit allows the user to create, control, and transform into mochi</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Mochi Body.</strong> You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, as physical objects pass through your mochi body. Additionally, you can move across Difficult Terrain created by mochi or sticky surfaces without spending extra Movement.</p>
<p><strong>Mochi Creation.</strong> As a mochi being, you are able to produce and control mochi in various ways. Any mochi produced with this devil fruit is thick and viscous enough to not be considered water to devil fruit users, but creatures fully submerged in mochi will suffocate and drown normally as if they are underwater. You are immune to suffocating in your own mochi.</p>
<p>You can spend 1 devil fruit charge to cast create or destroy water as a 1st-level spell slot, without expending a spell slot or material components. Instead of producing or destroying water with this spell, you produce or destroy edible mochi that is much thicker than water in the same amount and volume. This mochi counts as food when consumed, but spoils after 24 hours. You may spend additional devil fruit charges to increase the level of this spell by 1 for every charge expended as a part of casting the spell. Additionally, you learn and can use the Shape Water cantrip on this mochi.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can spend a bonus action to harden the mochi into a solid block of mochi which can expand up to a 10-by-10 ft cube, but counts as the same amount of food. A creature in the mochi's space when it expands is pushed out safely to the nearest space.</p>
<p><strong>Mochi Reach.</strong> You learn the mage hand cantrip. Additionally, when you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can make its reach extend up to 30 feet by stretching your mochi limbs.</p>
<p><strong>Mochi Weapon.</strong> As a bonus action, you can transform any part of your body into a melee weapon of your choice. This can range from turning an arm into a longsword, fingers into dagger-like blades, or even combining your arms or legs into a greatclub. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. You can use this part of your body as a weapon attack, and you are proficient with it. You can only use one weapon active this way at a time, and can dismiss it using a bonus action. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon created this way while it is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or become grappled by you as it sticks to the mochi surface.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Mochi Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Buzz Cut Mochi (as Zephyr Strike; 1 charge), Willow Mochi (as Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Burning Mochi (as Scorching Ray; 2 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Mochi Grasp (as Maximillian's Earthen Grasp; 2 charges), Wall of Mochi (as Wall of Water, but made of mochi; 3 charges), Mochi Tentacles (as Evard's Black Tentacles; 4 charges), Mochi Hand (Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), or Mochi Shield (as Fizban's Platinum Shield; Self; 6 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Unstoppable Donuts).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily manifest large amounts of concentrated mochi from the environment, which you can control telepathically to create two floating fists which emerge from mochi donuts. When you do so, the two large hands appear within 120 feet of you at a point you can see, which act as Bigby's Hand (no concentration required), and last for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. You can use an action on your turn to create an additional hand this way, which appears within 120 feet of you, and lasts until the duration of this ability ends. As a bonus action, you can move and act with any number of mochi hands you control at once, as per the spell description of Bigby's Hand for each. Once used, you can't use this awakening again for another 24 hours.</p>

<h5 id="bari-bari-no-mi-barrier">Bari Bari no Mi (Barrier)</h5>
<p><em>Devil Fruit, Very Rare</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Substance Generator Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> An emerald green melon with a swirl pattern across its surface and a crescent-shaped stem. Its surface is extremely hard, and very difficult to bite through.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This devil fruit allows the user to create and manipulate magical barriers made of force.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Barrier Creation.</strong> As an action, you can cast Wall of Force at will without expending a spell slot, charges, or material components. However, when you cast it using this feature, you can only produce one 10-by-10 foot panel or a 5-foot diameter sphere centered on you with it.</p>
<p><strong>Barrier Crash.</strong> While concentrating on a Wall of Force barrier you have created using this devil fruit power, you can spend an action to push it up to 30 feet in any direction, or until it collides with an unmovable object or terrain. Anything in the path of the moving barrier must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, as the barrier slams against it. On a failure, the target is knocked prone, takes 2d8 force damage, and is pushed by the barrier up to the total distance you move it. On a success, it is only pushed by the barrier. If a creature is squished between your barrier and another object and fails the saving throw, it instead takes 4d8 force damage and is restrained until it breaks free (escape DC equal to your Devil Fruit save DC). On a success or if the creature breaks free, it is pushed out to the nearest empty space that your barrier isn't pushing against.</p>
<p><strong>Barrierbility.</strong> As an action, you can manipulate any active Wall of Force you have created to rearrange its panels into a shape of your choice, so long as each panel is still connected to another panel. For example, you can reform it into a staircase with each step being an individual panel of the wall. Any creature or object in the path of the shifting wall is not pushed or damaged by it.</p>
<p><strong>Barrier Fist.</strong> Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 devil fruit charge to deal an 2d8 force damage to the target, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or you can knock it prone. You can expend additional devil fruit charges to deal another 1d8 force damage per additional charge expended, up to a total of 10d8 force damage.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Barrier Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Otiluke's Resilient Sphere (4 charges), Wall of Force (5 charges), Barrier Hand (as Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), or Forcecage (7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Gigabarrier).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily manifest large amounts of energy from the environment, which you can then form and reshape into a massive barrier. When you do so, you cast a special Wall of Force, without expending a spell slot or material components. This special wall of force can have up to a hundred panels, and its radius is up to 100 feet instead. Once used, you can't use this awakening again for another 24 hours.</p>

<p><em>Devil Fruit, Very Rare</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Environment Alterer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A stainless steel fruit with tons of bolt-shaped barbs and cloud-like swirls across its surface. It has a yellow coil wrapping around it up to the stem, which appears like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This devil fruit allows the user to control the magnetism and control metallic objects using magnetic forces.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetokinesis.</strong> You can use the Telekinesis and Levitate spells at will, without expending a spell slot, charge, or material components. You can only target objects made of metal and creatures wearing or holding metal or metallic items using these spells this way.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Repel.</strong> When targeted and hit by an attack from a weapon or ammo which is made of metal, you can use your reaction and spend 7 devil fruit charges to attempt to repel the attack, causing the damage to become 0. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes half of the damage they would have dealt to you, as the attack is redirected back to them.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Assembly.</strong> As an action, you can attract a large amount of metal within 120 feet of you toward your body to assemble onto your body. You must spend 1 devil fruit charge for every 5-foot square of metal you attract and assemble onto your body. For each square of metal you assemble onto you, you gain 10 temporary hit points (which only stacks with each additional shadow absorbed) up to a maximum of 30, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage (up to a maximum bonus of 3d4), your reach with melee weapons extends by 5 feet (up to a 15 foot total bonus), and your size increases by one (up to gargantuan). While this form is active, you have advantage on strength checks and saving throws. When you lose all temporary hit points granted by this ability, the metal you assembled is destroyed, and this ability ends.</p>
<p><strong>Electromagnetic Cannon.</strong> As an action, you can spend 3 devil fruit charges to create a large electromagnetic cannon from metal around you. When you do so, you can fire a beam of electromagnetic energy forming a line of 100 feet long and 5 feet wide out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. A creature takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save and is pushed back 20 feet away from you, or half as much damage on a successful one and isn't pushed. You can spend additional devil fruit charges to increase the bludgeoning damage by 1d6 and the push distance by 10 feet for each additional charge spent, up to a total of 12d6 bludgeoning damage and 80 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Magnetic Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Catapult (targeting metal; 1 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Cloud of Daggers (2 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Fly (Self; 3 charges), Conjure Barrage (3 charges), Conjure Volley (5 charges), Scrap Metal Hand (as Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), Blade Barrier (6 charges), or Reverse Gravity (only affecting metallic objects and creatures wearing metal; 7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Magnetic Assignment).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to mark two targets, which can be objects or creatures you can see within 120 feet of you, which causes them to become magnetically attracted to each other, even if they aren't made of metal or wearing metal. This magnetic attraction lasts for 1 minute, or until you fall unconscious. While these two targets are magnetically attracted to each other this way, each target at the start of each of its turns must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save. On a failure, it is magnetically pulled up to 120 feet toward the other target, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled, unless the target is already within 5 feet of it. A target that is slammed into by an object or creature this way must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the same damage on a failure or half as much on a success. Alternatively, you may force a target that fails its strength saving throw on its turn to be pushed away from the other target, up to a 120 foot gap between the two targets. If it is pushed away this way and crashes into an object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled from the crash.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may spend an action on subsequent turns for the duration to cause metalic objects in the area to crash into a target you have marked this way, forcing the target to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 8d6 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. If both marked targets are within 5 feet of each other, both must make this saving throw.</p>
<p>Once used, you can't use this awakening again for another 24 hours.</p>

<p><em>Devil Fruit, Legendary</em></p>
<p><strong>Type.</strong> Environment Alterer Paramecia</p>
<p><strong>Fruit appearance.</strong> A red heart-shaped melon with swirls</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> Allows the user to create a zone of control around them that they can manipulate in a variety of ways.</p>
<p><strong>Sea Weakness.</strong> You are weak to water and seastone.</p>
<p><strong>Counter Shock &amp; Room.</strong> You learn the Shocking Grasp cantrip. Additionally, you can use a bonus action to create a 60-foot radius psychic sphere, or "room", centered on where you are standing when you create it. You must maintain concentration on this room (as if concentrating on a spell). The room lasts for 1 minute, or until you end it using a bonus action. You can only have one room up at a time. Each turn, you can use an another bonus action to increase the radius of the room by another 60 feet. Any creature you can see within the room can be targeted by any leveled spell casted using this devil fruit under "Room Spells", regardless of spell range. Additionally, the range of spells or any spell effect listed in "room spells" can be extended to anywhere within the "room", but is also limited by the range of the room and cannot be cast outside it or affect anything outside the room's radius. For example, misty step's range increases from 60 feet up to the range of anywhere within the room's radius. Room Spells which normally require concentration don't require concentration while cast within the Room's radius, but will end when the Room's duration ends or when you lose concentration on the room.</p>
<p>You can spend an action to Scan the radius of your room to spot a creature you are aware of that is behind full cover or hidden within the room's range. You can do this by rolling a perception check against the creature's stealth to locate it. A creature spotted this way cannot gain the benefits of full cover against your Devil Fruit Spells while within the room's range, and can be seen by you as if they were fully visible, becoming outlined by Faerie Fire.</p>
<p><strong>Surgery Scalpel.</strong> As an action, you can designate a melee weapon you are proficient with that deals slashing or piercing damage as your Surgery Scalpel when using your Ope Ope no Mi powers. The weapon becomes magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance if it isn't already. Additionally, when you hit a creature within your Room with your Surgery Scalpel, once per turn you can forego dealing damage and instead use one of the following effects against the target:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Injection Shot:</strong> You can spend 1 devil fruit charge to deal an extra 2d8 necrotic damage to the target with your Surgery Scalpel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gamma Knife:</strong> You can spend 3 devil fruit charges to deal an extra 3d8 radiant damage to the target with your Surgery Scalpel. Additionally, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or become poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turn, ending the condition on a success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Amputate:</strong> You cleanly slice off one of the creature's limbs for 10 minutes, but dealing no harm to it in the process. Each time you remove a creature's limbs this way, it gains a level of exhaustion (up to a maximum of 5 levels of exhaustion) so long as the limbs aren't attached. A creature that has had its limbs removed this way can spend an action to re-attach all its limbs, ending all levels of exhaustion applied by the amputation on itself. You can spend 1 devil fruit charge when using this attack during your turn to apply "Radio Knife" to the Amputation, dealing 1d8 electric damage to the target, and causing the creature to become unable to re-attach it's missing limb unless its succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC as a part of its action to re-attach its limbs. If the creature fails the saving throw, its action is wasted and its limbs remain unattached.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shambles.</strong> You can target two creatures or objects, including yourself, within your "room" as an action. The two targets magically teleport to each other's spaces and swap places.</p>
<p><strong>Immortality Surgery.</strong> By spending 10 minutes operating on another creature, you grant it immortality. The target stops aging. It is immune to any effect that would age it, and it can't die from old age. However, you will die and be reduced to dust upon completing this surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Room Spells.</strong> This devil fruit power has 17 charges. While within the "room", you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: catapult (1 charge, can be cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), detect poison and disease (1 charge), cure wounds (1 charge, can be cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), find traps (2 charges), hold person (2 charges, can be cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), levitate (2 charges), silence (2 charges), see invisibility (only within room; 2 charges), vortex warp (2 charges), gravity sinkhole (4 charges), hold monster (5 charges), mass cure wounds (5 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), move earth (6 charges), whirlwind (7 charges), or tether essence (7 charges).

You can use either of these special rooms for 1 minute after activating your awakening (but cannot activate your regular Room or both at the same time), or until you fall unconscious, and they do not require concentration to maintain:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>K-ROOM:</strong> You apply your Room to your designated Surgery Scalpel as a special coating for the duration. While this special Room is active, your Surgery Scalpel weapon's reach becomes 60 feet. You can use a bonus action while your K-ROOM coating is active to extend your Surgery Scalpel's reach by an additional 60 feet. Additionally, when you hit a creature with K-ROOM coated Surgery Scalpel, once per turn you can forego dealing damage and instead use one of the following effects against the target:</li>
<li><strong>Shock Surge:</strong> You send a deadly shock through the target, dealing 10d10 lightning damage to it.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Puncture Surge:</strong> The target is pushed away from you to the end of your weapon's reach and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was pushed. If the target is pushed into another creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>R-ROOM:</strong> You apply your Room to a target within 120 feet of you. The room is a 10-foot-radius sphere which surrounds the target. Until the duration ends, the sphere moves with the target, centered on it. This room acts as an Antimagic Field spell.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Quake Strike.</strong> Once per turn, when you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 or more devil fruit charges to release a quake strike. If you do so, the target and all other creatures within 15 feet of you must also make a Constitution saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failure, a target takes 1d8 thunder damage, plus 1d8 for each charge expended, and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a success, a target takes half as much thunder damage, and isn't pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the attack's effect, and the effect emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Deadly Quakes).</strong> This devil fruit power has 17 charges.

While a creature is unconscious this way, it has its astral body projected into a closed-off section of the Astral Plane (following the rules of the Astral Projection spell), named the "Song World". The Song World closely resembles the real world, and you can manipulate and affect the world and objects or creatures within it using your Devil Fruit powers.</p>
<p>You are able to enter the Song World while you are still conscious, projecting your astral body into the Song World at will. You can control your astral body and physical body at the same time. You can only use your Song World Spells against creatures within your Song World using your astral body and your Song World Spells with a range of Self can only be used on your astral body, not your physical body. Additionally, if you fall unconscious while creatures are within your Song World, their astral bodies are returned to their physical bodies and their physical body regains consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Song Puppets.</strong> As an action, if a humanoid creature is unconscious due to your Song World feature, you are able to make its physical body a Song Puppet while it remains unconscious.

The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or the creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. A creature that is frightened of you has disadvantage on this saving throw. If a creature is immune to the frightened condition or necrotic damage, it is not affected by this ability. This reduction is permanent, unless a Greater Restoration, Heal, or Wish spell is used on the target. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. Additionally, whenever a creature fails this saving throw and has its hit point maximum reduced by this ability, you gain 1 devil fruit charge.</p>

If a creature only has 1 maximum hit point, an Incarnation cannot use Soul Pocus on it. An Incarnation follows your orders and lasts until you dismiss it as a bonus action. It can collect up to 5 devil fruit charges from creatures this way, which it can then transfer to you as an action while it is within 5 feet of you.</p>

<p>The Soul Monster is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.</p>

<p><strong>Island Body.</strong> You can spend 4 devil fruit charges to mold the stone around you to polymorph (as if using the polymorph spell) yourself into a stone construct or earth elemental that has a challenge rating equal to or less than your level for up to 1 hour. However, your mental ability scores remain the same and you can speak while in this form. You remain this way as long as you concentrate on maintaining it (as if concentrating on a spell). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. You can continue to use your Devil Fruit abilities and spells in this form, so long as they don't require concentration, but cannot use any other class or racial features or spells for the duration.</p>
<p><strong>Spells (Island Techniques).</strong> This devil fruit power has 17 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Earth Tremor (1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Maximilian’s Earthen Grasp (2 charges), Erupting Earth (3 charges), Stoneskin (4 charges), Wrath of Nature (5 charges), Investiture of Stone (6 charges), Move Earth (6 charges), Earthquake (8 charges), or Tsunami (8 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Awakening (Total Island Dominion).</strong> Once you've awakened your power, you can spend an action to polymorph into a Zaratan from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes for 1 minute, using your Island Body feature. However, you still have a swim speed of 0 in this form and are subject to your Sea Weakness. Once used, you can’t activate your awakening again for another 24 hours.</p>
