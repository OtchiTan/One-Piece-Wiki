For more rules for running such a campaign, consider checking out the companion books Dungeons and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook and Dungeons and Devil Fruits Dungeon Master's Guide. When combined with the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB, this book offers a deeper understanding of the principles that shape these powers within the 5th Edition D&amp;D landscape.</p> <p>Within these pages, you'll discover an extensive collection of Devil Fruits, each presented with magic item-inspired stat blocks. While many are drawn directly from the series, others are entirely original or adapted for D&amp;D 5th Edition. For those who wish to introduce an element of randomness to finding these fruits, Chapter 7 of the Dungeons and Devil Fruits Player's Handbook features tables allowing for random Devil Fruit generation. Alternatively, DMs can personally handpick specific Devil Fruits to enhance the abilities of players or enemies.</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Devil%20Fruits%20Encyclopedia/#severe-power-discrepancies-with-devil-fruits","title":"Severe power discrepancies with Devil Fruits?","text":"<p>It's possible that, with sheer randomness, players may end up with an exceptionally powerful or underwhelming Devil Fruit. This inherent unpredictability is what renders the Devil Fruits so interesting, yet risky. If you believe this randomness detracts from the enjoyment or balance of your game, consider personally choosing the fruits that align with your own campaign's balance and design philosophy. You're also encouraged to adjust any Devil Fruit sheets to better match your group's preferences.</p> <p>Should you wish, consider introducing scaled versions of the powers, especially for the rarer Devil Fruits. This scaling option depends on player level or progress throughout the campaign. While this approach might initially temper the excitement of certain Devil Fruits, it allows DMs to distribute more formidable Devil Fruit without destroying the game's balance early on.</p> <p>To the right, you'll find optional Devil Fruit advancement rules based on player levels, tailored to the distinct types of Devil Fruits: Paramecia, Zoan, and Logia. These regulations primarily target the substantial advantages that Very Rare and Legendary Devil Fruits might grant early in a campaign. For instance, a Legendary Devil Fruit granting 17 charges and access to 9th level spells might be restricted to its 5th level spells and a maximum of 9 charges for a level 9 player, until they reach later levels in the campaign. This would NOT raise a Devil Fruit's highest spell level, maximum charges or maximum challenge rating if it has lower than the threshold on these tables, unless a player takes the Devil Fruit Evolution advancement available in the Dungeons and Devil Fruits PHB. Regardless of these limitations, all other abilities on the Devil Fruit sheet remain available. Such a system can add layers of progression, enriching the narrative while ensuring gameplay remains balanced.</p> <p>Optional Rule: Devil Fruit Scaling (Paramecia and Logia)</p> <p>Player Level Highest Spell Level Max Charges</p> <p>1st 1st 2</p> <p>3rd 2nd 3</p> <p>5th 3rd 5</p> <p>7th 4th 7</p> <p>9th 5th 9</p> <p>11th 6th 11</p> <p>13th 7th 13</p> <p>15th 8th 15</p> <p>17th 9th 17</p> <p>Optional Rule: Devil Fruit Scaling (Zoan)</p> <p>Player Level Required Beast Shape Adjusted Max CR</p> <p>1st 1/8</p> <p>2nd 1/4</p> <p>3rd 1/2</p> <p>4th 1</p> <p>5th 2</p> <p>6th 3</p> <p>7th 7</p> <p>8th 8</p> <p>9th 9</p> <p>10th 10</p> <p>11th 11</p> <p>12th 12</p> <p>13th 13</p> <p>13th 14</p> <p>14th 15</p> <p>15th 16</p> <p>16th 17</p> <p>17th 20</p> <p>CHAPTER 0 | INTRODUCTION </p> <p>\\page</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Devil%20Fruits%20Encyclopedia/#should-i-allow-my-players-to-view-this-book","title":"Should I allow my players to view this book?","text":"<p>The question of whether players should be privy to this compendium is a valid concern.

You require 100,000 gold pieces or 400 gold bars (or \u0e3f1,000,000,000 worth of gold) to form each individual 5-foot diameter sphere this way. Once you use this action, you cannot use it again for another 24 hours. </p> <p>Any gold being telekinetically controlled by this ability is considered liquid (but doesn't count against a Devil Fruit user's Sea Weakness) unless otherwise stated, and counts as difficult terrain when moved through in its liquid state. Creatures will suffocate inside liquid gold if they remain inside it. Any gold forcibly moved 60 feet away from you while being telekinetically controlled returns to an empty space you can see within 60 feet of you at the start of your next turn. Additionally, while the spheres are under your telekinetic control, you can spend an action to use one of the following effects on the gold during your turn:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Combine/Separate: You can combine the volumes of the gold spheres to form a larger mass of liquefied gold with a total volume no greater than the total volumes of your currently controlled gold, or split the mass back apart into independent 5-foot diameter spheres. </p> </li> <li> <p>Slam: You can slam a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold into a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Armory: You can use a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold to form any weapon or armor of your choice. You are proficient with any gold weapon or armor you use, and ignore strength requirements to use it. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. The gold cannot be controlled or used while it is used as a weapon or piece of armor, unless you reform it back into a sphere a bonus action. </p> </li> <li> <p>Bind: You can use a single 5-foot diameter sphere of gold to target a creature within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, or become restrained by the gold for 1 minute or until it breaks free (escape DC equal to your Devil Fruit save DC). The gold cannot be controlled or used while it restrains a creature, unless you free the creature from it as a bonus action.</p> </li> <li> <p>Animate: You use one sphere of gold to construct a solid Gold Golem (as Iron Golem; stats found in the standard 5th Edition Monster Manual). It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands. When it falls to 0 hit points or otherwise gets destroyed, so does the gold sphere used to construct it. You can only have one Gold Golem activate at a time, and once you create one you can't create anohter one for 24 hours.</p> </li> <li> <p>Collect: You condense the gold into tiny rings you collect, one ring per 5-foot diameter sphere of gold. You gain 1 devil fruit charge per ring collected, not exceeding 13 total charges, but can no longer affect the collected gold telepathically using your Gold Manipulation feature until you re-activate the feature.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Spells (Golden Techniques). This devil fruit power has 13 maximum charges, but you start with none. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Golden Burst (as Thunderous Smite; 1 charge), Golden Arms (as Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Gold Wave (as Tidal Wave, made of liquid gold; 3 charges), Golden Tentacles (as Evard's Black Tentacles; 4 charges), Golden Hand (as Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), Golden Wall (as Wall of Stone; 5 charges), Flesh to Gold (as Flesh to Stone; 6 charges), and Golden Inferno (as Firestorm; 7 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges when you use your \"Collect\" ability. All material created using these spells return back to the original gold value used to create the devil fruit charges to fuel it after the spell's duration ends.</p> <p>Awakening (Gold Splash). Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily alchemically manifest gold from the environment, which you can control telepathically. When you do so, you can use this gold to cast Tsunami, with a 1 action casting time. After the Tsunami ends, the gold returns back to mundane, nonmagical materials. Once used, you can't use this action again for another 24 hours.</p> <p>CHAPTER 3 | VERY RARE PARAMECIA</p> <p>\\page</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Devil%20Fruits%20Encyclopedia/#mochi-mochi-no-mi-mochi","title":"Mochi Mochi no Mi (Mochi)","text":"<p>Devil Fruit, Very Rare</p> <p>Type.

You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks, as physical objects pass through your mochi body. Additionally, you can move across Difficult Terrain created by mochi or sticky surfaces without spending extra Movement.</p> <p>Mochi Creation. As a mochi being, you are able to produce and control mochi in various ways. Any mochi produced with this devil fruit is thick and viscous enough to not be considered water to devil fruit users, but creatures fully submerged in mochi will suffocate and drown normally as if they are underwater. You are immune to suffocating in your own mochi.</p> <p>You can spend 1 devil fruit charge to cast create or destroy water as a 1st-level spell slot, without expending a spell slot or material components. Instead of producing or destroying water with this spell, you produce or destroy edible mochi that is much thicker than water in the same amount and volume. This mochi counts as food when consumed, but spoils after 24 hours. You may spend additional devil fruit charges to increase the level of this spell by 1 for every charge expended as a part of casting the spell. Additionally, you learn and can use the Shape Water cantrip on this mochi.</p> <p>Additionally, you can spend a bonus action to harden the mochi into a solid block of mochi which can expand up to a 10-by-10 ft cube, but counts as the same amount of food. A creature in the mochi's space when it expands is pushed out safely to the nearest space.</p> <p>Mochi Reach. You learn the mage hand cantrip. Additionally, when you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can make its reach extend up to 30 feet by stretching your mochi limbs.</p> <p>Mochi Weapon.

This can range from turning an arm into a longsword, fingers into dagger-like blades, or even combining your arms or legs into a greatclub. Weapons you create have the same properties as their normal counterparts but are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance. You can use this part of your body as a weapon attack, and you are proficient with it. You can only use one weapon active this way at a time, and can dismiss it using a bonus action. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon created this way while it is within 5 feet of you, it must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or become grappled by you as it sticks to the mochi surface.</p> <p>Spells (Mochi Techniques). This devil fruit power has 13 charges. You can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without needing to expend material components: Buzz Cut Mochi (as Zephyr Strike; 1 charge), Willow Mochi (as Arms of Hadar; 1 charge, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Burning Mochi (as Scorching Ray; 2 charges, and can cast at higher levels by spending additional charges), Mochi Grasp (as Maximillian's Earthen Grasp; 2 charges), Wall of Mochi (as Wall of Water, but made of mochi; 3 charges), Mochi Tentacles (as Evard's Black Tentacles; 4 charges), Mochi Hand (Bigby's Hand; 5 charges), or Mochi Shield (as Fizban's Platinum Shield; Self; 6 charges). The devil fruit regains expended charges daily at dawn.</p> <p>Awakening (Unstoppable Donuts). Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily manifest large amounts of concentrated mochi from the environment, which you can control telepathically to create two floating fists which emerge from mochi donuts. When you do so, the two large hands appear within 120 feet of you at a point you can see, which act as Bigby's Hand (no concentration required), and last for 1 minute or until you fall unconscious. You can use an action on your turn to create an additional hand this way, which appears within 120 feet of you, and lasts until the duration of this ability ends. As a bonus action, you can move and act with any number of mochi hands you control at once, as per the spell description of Bigby's Hand for each.

You are weak to water and seastone.</p> <p>Barrier Creation. As an action, you can cast Wall of Force at will without expending a spell slot, charges, or material components. However, when you cast it using this feature, you can only produce one 10-by-10 foot panel or a 5-foot diameter sphere centered on you with it.</p> <p>Barrier Crash. While concentrating on a Wall of Force barrier you have created using this devil fruit power, you can spend an action to push it up to 30 feet in any direction, or until it collides with an unmovable object or terrain. Anything in the path of the moving barrier must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC, as the barrier slams against it. On a failure, the target is knocked prone, takes 2d8 force damage, and is pushed by the barrier up to the total distance you move it. On a success, it is only pushed by the barrier. If a creature is squished between your barrier and another object and fails the saving throw, it instead takes 4d8 force damage and is restrained until it breaks free (escape DC equal to your Devil Fruit save DC).

Any creature or object in the path of the shifting wall is not pushed or damaged by it.</p> <p>Barrier Fist. Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend 1 devil fruit charge to deal an 2d8 force damage to the target, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC or you can knock it prone. You can expend additional devil fruit charges to deal another 1d8 force damage per additional charge expended, up to a total of 10d8 force damage.</p> <p>Spells (Barrier Techniques).

Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to temporarily manifest large amounts of energy from the environment, which you can then form and reshape into a massive barrier.

You can use the Telekinesis and Levitate spells at will, without expending a spell slot, charge, or material components. You can only target objects made of metal and creatures wearing or holding metal or metallic items using these spells this way.</p> <p>Magnetic Repel. When targeted and hit by an attack from a weapon or ammo which is made of metal, you can use your reaction and spend 7 devil fruit charges to attempt to repel the attack, causing the damage to become 0. The attacker must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Devil Fruit save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes half of the damage they would have dealt to you, as the attack is redirected back to them.</p> <p>Magnetic Assembly. As an action, you can attract a large amount of metal within 120 feet of you toward your body to assemble onto your body. You must spend 1 devil fruit charge for every 5-foot square of metal you attract and assemble onto your body. For each square of metal you assemble onto you, you gain 10 temporary hit points (which only stacks with each additional shadow absorbed) up to a maximum of 30, your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage (up to a maximum bonus of 3d4), your reach with melee weapons extends by 5 feet (up to a 15 foot total bonus), and your size increases by one (up to gargantuan).

Once you've awakened your power, you can use an action to mark two targets, which can be objects or creatures you can see within 120 feet of you, which causes them to become magnetically attracted to each other, even if they aren't made of metal or wearing metal. This magnetic attraction lasts for 1 minute, or until you fall unconscious. While these two targets are magnetically attracted to each other this way, each target at the start of each of its turns must make a Strength saving throw against your Devil Fruit save. On a failure, it is magnetically pulled up to 120 feet toward the other target, taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled, unless the target is already within 5 feet of it. A target that is slammed into by an object or creature this way must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the same damage on a failure or half as much on a success. Alternatively, you may force a target that fails its strength saving throw on its turn to be pushed away from the other target, up to a 120 foot gap between the two targets. If it is pushed away this way and crashes into an object, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet traveled from the crash.</p> <p>Additionally, you may spend an action on subsequent turns for the duration to cause metalic objects in the area to crash into a target you have marked this way, forcing the target to make a Dexterity saving throw.

Once a component accumulates 3 or more major failures, it falls to 0 hit points and needs to be repaired. If 3 total failed checks or more are counted, the ship needs to be rebuilt from scratch all over again, effectively doubling the building time.</p> <p>Once a number of successes equal to the 1 + the ship's Constitution modifier are counted over the total course of the required building period, the ship is finished and ready for use (using the stat blocks below).</p> <p>Major Shipbuilding Success Table</p> <p>d4 Success Type</p> <p>1 Hard Material: Component gains 1d4 bonus to its damage threshold</p> <p>2 Dense Coating: Component gains a +1 bonus to AC (Max 20)</p> <p>3 Well-Assembled: Component gains 1d12 maximum hit points.</p> <p>4 Flawless Design: Any critical hit against the component becomes a normal hit.</p> <p>Major Shipbuilding Failure Table</p> <p>d4 Failure Type</p> <p>1 Brittle Material: If a component has a damage threshold, it is decreased by 1d4.</p> <p>2 Cracked exterior: Component loses 1 AC (Min 10)</p> <p>3 Poorly Assembled: Component loses 1d12 maximum hit points.</p> <p>4 Exposed Weakpoint: Attacks made against the component have advantage.</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Dungeon%20Master%20Guide/#sample-stat-blocks","title":"Sample Stat Blocks","text":"<p>Here are some example ship stat blocks of ships you can purchase or attain (availability and price list also included in Chapter 5 of the Unofficial One Piece D&amp;D Player's Guide).</p> <p>CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING</p> <p>\\page</p> <p>CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING</p> <p>\\page</p> <p>CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING</p> <p>\\page</p> <p>CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING</p> <p>\\page</p> <p>CHAPTER 2 | SHIPS AND SAILING</p> <p>\\page</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Dungeon%20Master%20Guide/#waver","title":"Waver","text":"<p>Medium special vehicle (5 ft. by 3 ft.)</p> <ul> <li>Cost \u0e3f5,000,000</li> <li>Upgrade Slots 0</li> <li>Crew Maximum 1 crew, 1 passenger</li> <li>Cargo Capacity 0.2 tons</li> <li>Travel Pace 25 miles per hour</li> </ul> STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA 10 (+0) 16 (+3) 10 (+0) 0 0 0 ___ - Damage Immunities poison, psychic - Condition Immunities blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, unconscious ___"},{"location":"English%20docs/Dungeon%20Master%20Guide/#hull","title":"Hull","text":"<p>Armor Class. 11</p> <p>Hit Points. 50</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Dungeon%20Master%20Guide/#control-and-movement-dial","title":"Control and Movement: Dial","text":"<p>Armor Class. 12</p> <p>Hit Points. 25</p> <p>Locomotion (water). large breath dial, speed 60 ft.</p> <p>Move up to its speed, with one 90-degree turn.

A talented navigator will often have a high Wisdom score, proficiency in Nature or Survival, and proficiency with navigator's tools.</p> <p>Doctor. The ship's doctor tends to injuries, monitors illness, and provides basic medical and scientific expertise. A skilled doctor should have a high Wisdom score and proficiency in Medicine to perform medical procedures or be capable of using healing abilities.</p> <p>Chef. The chef is responsible for nourishing and preparing meals for the crew. Food and drink is the lifeblood of every crew, and the importance of quality and taste in each meal should never be underestimated, as it provides a great deal strength and motivation to every other member of the crew.

Large crews may want to designate officer positions for managing each section of the crew. </p> <p>When the size of a crew's ship increases, most captains will need to hire additional crew members to keep the ship running. To find more people to fill these spots, hirelings are used. Hirelings can be found in places where seafaring communities are more common, typically in large port cities.</p> <p>For every 10 hirelings on board a ship, there should be at least one officer managing them to maintain order. This officer can take on a leader position in the chain of command under the captain and first mate, reporting to them at the end of each day.

Additional crew roles can be filled by hired officers or they can be ordered to assist other officers with their job (A chef that needs help in the kitchen may make one officer their assistant chef).</p> <p>The downside to recruiting hirelings is that they can be expensive to maintain in higher quantities and aren't usually as loyal as most player characters will be. The average weekly wage for a single hireling crew member is \u0e3f15,000 (\u0e3f60,000 each month) and the average weekly wage for a hireling officer or specialist is \u0e3f150,000 (\u0e3f600,000 each month).

Spellcasters aboard ships have the unique opportunity to bend the raw power of their magic in conjunction with the brute force of maritime warfare. By using a spell on a ship's cannons or components, a spellcaster can choose one of the following effects based on the spell and affected component:</p> <p>Spell-Infused Cannons: Spellcasters, especially those with evocation or enchantment tendencies, can meld their power with artillery. Before a cannon or weapon component is fired, a spellcaster can channel a stored spell into the cannonball as an action, so long as the spell's casting time is 1 action. When this enchanted cannonball impacts its target, the stored spell is released at the point of impact. For example, a cannonball infused with the Hold Person spell might paralyze a hit crewmember upon detonation. A cannonball infused with the Fireball spell can release the spell's effect centered at its point of impact. The spellcaster must expend a spell slot when infusing the cannonball as an action, and the released spell affects an area equivalent to its normal range or a 10-foot radius, whichever is smaller.</p> <p>Protective Barriers: Abjuration magic can offer valuable protection to a vessel and its crew. Tinkerers and other spellcasters can extend spells like Shield or Protective Ward to envelop parts of their ship, so long as they are standing on the ship and are within 5 feet of the component they are trying to protect. This mystical barrier can deflect projectiles or mitigate the impact of spells aimed at the ship. The larger the area covered, the higher the spell slot required. Covering a Medium-sized component (such as a cannon) with a spell requires a 1st-level spell slot or higher, covering a Large component (such as the Helm) requires a 2nd-level spell slot or higher, covering a Huge Component (such as the Sails) requires a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, and covering a Gargantuan component (such as the Hull) requires a 4th-level spell slot or higher. The protection lasts for the duration of the spell.</p> <p>Wind Magic: Channeling air-based magic (such as from a Gust of Wind spell) into the sails can allow the ship to maneuver with unmatched grace. For the duration, the ship can turn on a dime, gains 15 feet of movement during its turn, and gains advantage on checks related to ship maneuverability. Alternatively, using this on an enemy ship offensively will allow you to slow its speed and reduce its maneuvarability.

However, many changes, small or large, had to occur to fit in newer mechanics such as Devil Fruits, Haki, new items, etc. For example, Druids were practically deleted to make room for Zoan-type Devil Fruit users. </p> <p>More detailed explanations on changes and additions made in this guide are listed below:</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Player%20Handbook/#version-100-changes","title":"Version 1.0.0 Changes","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Many buffs were applied to player races, classes, and advancement features. These buffs were made to compensate for newer mechanics such as devil fruits, special items, and magic items potentially throwing off the balance of combat and resources. Players who managed to access these new resources early on will be much stronger than they would be in base 5e. </p> </li> <li> <p>Challenge Rating rules for monsters and enemies may need to be adjusted to match player buffs. Monsters written in the Dungeons and Devil Fruits Dungeon Master's guide will hopefully provide enough insight and design ideas to further help compensate for these player buffs. I think this is a positive as well DMs will be able to swarm their players with low-strength enemies more easily without risking killing them, which much better suits a One Piece campaign. Very high CR enemies should still serve as an adequate threat to players if they get too cocky.</p> </li> <li> <p>Character creation has been left largely the same in Chapter 1, with the option to allow players to start with a Devil Fruit, Haki, or a Character Feat to give them a strength boost early on. Standard 5th Edition character sheets can still be used, although additional pages or handouts detailing Haki or Devil Fruit powers and advancements may be needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Level &amp; Adventure Tiers give a bit more description for how to run longer camapigns in this One Piece-themed world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Every race aside from humans has been swapped out for One Piece races, each detailed in Chapter 2. Because some races in One Piece are naturally powerful or mechanically \"different\" from most balanced races in 5e, certain races have been listed as \"optional\". This means the DM needs to give players permission in order to use those races. I knew people might be unhappy if I left out these more powerful races, so that is why I included them in spite of their difficult-to-balance nature.</p> </li> <li> <p>Certain classes in Chapter 3 have been altered or sort of re-skinned to fit the theme of One Piece better. </p> </li> <li> <p>Barbarians have been completely swapped out for \"Bruisers\", which better represents the abundance of brawler types in One Piece who either don't use weapons or hold basic club-like weapons (e.g. Luffy, Garp, Kaido, etc.) This was heavily inspired by the Pugilist Class by Benjamin Huffman, which more or less combines monks with barbarians. Hopefully after initial testing, this class will feel fun and balanced to use.</p> </li> <li> <p>Martial Artists are Monks with Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (TCoE) changes applied. Subclasses for this class were inspired by original monk subclasses, but combined together to better match the various forms of martial arts in the One Piece world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Warriors are basically just fighters. Much like Martial Artists, minor buffs and additional changes were applied from various official books. Subclasses here include a Haki focus, cursed sword styles, and a number of One Piece-themed fighting styles.</p> </li> <li> <p>Marksmen are also just rogues with changes made to proficiencies, flavor, and replacing perception-based class features with Observation Haki features. The subclasses here resemble rogue subclasses, but place an emphasis on proficiency with different varieties of weapons and powers added to fit one One Piece world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tinkerers are a technology-based casters that replace wizards. Because \"magic\" in One Piece is instead explained as technology, devil fruit powers, haki, spiritual powers, paranormal phenomenon, or simply random wacky occurences, casters as a whole have been changed to meet this theme. Tinkerers are wizards who replace \"magic\" with fictional science and technology which better suits the One Piece world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Skalds are sea-themed bards with largely the same toolset and abilities. Most of the class-based changes made were very minor and really just made for flavor.</p> </li> <li> <p>Same as skalds, priests are virtually the exact same as clerics. Because clerics are best at dealing with undead, I originally wanted to repurpose their Channel Divinity to be more universal, perhaps turning \"spirits\" instead of undead. But I figured I would leave it up to the DM to explain how undead can be incorporated in the world via Devil Fruits and science in the One Piece world to make priests still feel useful as a class.</p> </li> <li> <p>In chapter 4, character backgrounds have been changed a bit and new backgrounds have been added. Pirate Prestige and Crew Roles are optional mechanics which give players a wider variety of tools they can use to provide utility to their crew. A table for character dreams was also provided.</p> </li> <li> <p>In chapter 5, metal coin currency was replaced with Belly (\u0e3f), except on some islands where exceptions are made, and conversion rules were included. </p> </li> </ul> <p>CHAPTER 0 | STARTING INFORMATION</p> <p>\\page</p> <ul> <li>Certain weapons and armor have been replaced with One Piece-themed gear. Additional guns and melee weapons have also been included.</li> <li>Standard equipment and special equipment tables now include One Piece themed gear that players can find and use throughout the campaign to strengthen their characters and abilities. Players can also create or upgrade certain equipment using crafting rules or class and races features.</li> <li>Multiclassing rules and features in chapter 6 are still similar to base 5e, but have been altered to match the changes made to classes. New One Piece-themed character features are also provided.</li> <li>In chapter 7, which is practically brand new, there are now rules on using Haki and Devil Fruits. To allow for more DM control over how players acquire these abilities, they are largely treated as rare magic items characters have to work hard to get their hands on. Even then, with items such as devil fruits, there is significant risk in trying to find a strong devil fruit power. Because these mechanics aren't tied to character level for the most part, the DM can decide at what points in the story to hand out advancement features or devil fruits to avoid balance nightmares. Alternatively, using random tables and generation can be used if balance isn't a huge concern.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Player%20Handbook/#version-110-changes","title":"Version 1.1.0 Changes","text":"<ul> <li>Minor formatting and spelling fixes as well some very small balance adjustments to classes.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Player%20Handbook/#version-200-changes","title":"Version 2.0.0 Changes","text":"<ul> <li>Pdf now includes new world map.</li> <li>Improved Table of Contents page.</li> <li>Plenty of new visuals and reformatting.</li> <li>Complete overhaul to \"Races\" section and the addition of the \"Giant Human Variant\".

As an example, you may end up with the six numbers 17, 11, 13, 9, 12, 14 after rolling. You might decide you want strength to be your highest Ability Score, so you would put 17 for your Strength Score. Then you would fill in your other Ability Scores accordingly.</p> <p>Lastly, one other way you can decide Ability Scores is through using Point Buy.

At this legendary tier, characters should be able to stand up to Yonko pirate crews and marine admirals. Most fights will be overwhelmingly large-scale and epic, involving hundreds or thousands of pirates in huge wars and battles across the end of the New World.

Fighting pointless battles, intentionally running into dangerous situations which have no reward, or simply trying to farm these points will not net the crew any points. At higher levels, you can also choose to elect an MVP character during an event. Players may decide someone in the crew went above and beyond in overcoming a challenge, and give them a large surge of pirate prestige points at the end of the encounter. An MVP may roll a 1d4 at the end of such an event, and gain a number of pirate prestige points equal to the number rolled.

The group may decide to elect one member of their crew, preferably the captain, as the Pirate King or Queen if they reach the end. Alternatively, the group may decide to agree on being equal and simply become a legendary crew of pirate kings and queens if they complete the campaign.</p> <p>The goal of this type of adventure is to explore whatever sea is required to get across to reach the reverse mountain to get to the grand line.

In this sense, hunting pirates or other rogue and anti-government factions would be the main objective.</p> <p>Alternatively, if your party insists on having an adventure-driven marine campaign, the DM may decide to run it similar to the pirate style campaign, with more of a focus on seizing the One Piece and controlling Raftel to keep it away from the reach of pirates, and having the goal of capturing major pirates be worked in as a secondary objective.</p> <p>Because most Marines serve their superiors in the Marines, World Government, Celestial Dragons, and Gorosei, the missions sent to you by these individuals may grant additional objectives to the party. Leveling up and completing objectives may also advance the party to a higher rank in the marines or world government, such as vice admiral, admiral, or even Cipher Pol Agent.</p> <p>The reputation system can still be utilized in this style of campaign, but instead of marine-controlled islands giving you automatically low reputation, they will automatically give you high reputation. Additionally, you will start with low reputation pirate-controlled islands. Pirates who encounter Marines will always attempt to drive them away, evade them, or attack them head-on to avoid arrest.</p> <p>Revolutionaries and other government-hating factions will also despise marines, potentially attacking them on sight.

The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses \u0e3f250,000 worth of powdered silver and special salts, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p> <p>Hunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this trap form s a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p> <p>Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p> <p>Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p> <p>Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p> <p>Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves\u2019 tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p> <p>Log Pose. A log pose, similar to a compass, helps navigators find their way to nearby islands or locations. However, log poses are special in that they are the only way to navigate on the Grand Line, since regular compasses don't work there. A log pose is used by spending a certain amount of time on an island (which could take hours, days, or years) to record the magnetic waves required to point it toward the next nearby island. Paradise log poses do not work in the New World, so a New World log pose is required to navigate there. New World log poses are 10 times more expensive than an ordinary log pose.</p> <p>Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p> <p>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</p> <p>\\page</p> <p>Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p> <p>Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p> <p>Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).</p> <p>Power Source. A power source is a special item\u2014a battery, a special dial, an energy crystal, a fuel rod, or a similar item\u2014designed to channel the power of abilities and spells. A tinkerer can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the 5th Edition D&amp;D Players Handbook.</p> <p>Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p> <p>Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p> <p>Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p> <p>Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p> <p>Scale, Merchant\u2019s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p> <p>Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p> <p>Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p> <p>Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch\u2014or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel\u2014takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p> <p>Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p> <p>Tools</p> <p>Item Cost Weight</p> <p>Artisan's Tools</p> <p>Alchemist\u2019s supplies \u0e3f500,000 8 lb.</p> <p>Brewer\u2019s supplies \u0e3f200,000 9 lb.</p> <p>Calligrapher's supplies \u0e3f100,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Carpenter\u2019s tools \u0e3f80,000 6 lb.</p> <p>Cartographer\u2019s tools \u0e3f150,000 6 lb.</p> <p>Cobbler\u2019s tools \u0e3f50,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Cook\u2019s utensils \u0e3f10,000 8 lb.</p> <p>Glassblower's tools \u0e3f300,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Jeweler\u2019s tools \u0e3f250,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Leatherworker\u2019s tools \u0e3f50,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Mason\u2019s tools \u0e3f100,000 8 lb.</p> <p>Painter\u2019s supplies \u0e3f100,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Potter\u2019s tools \u0e3f100,000 3 lb.</p> <p>Smith\u2019s tools \u0e3f200,000 8 lb.</p> <p>Tinker\u2019s tools \u0e3f500,000 10 lb.</p> <p>Weaver\u2019s tools \u0e3f10,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Woodcarver's tools \u0e3f10,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Disguise kit \u0e3f250,000 3 lb.</p> <p>Forgery kit \u0e3f150,000 5 lb.</p> <p>Gaming set</p> <p>Dice set \u0e3f1,000 -</p> <p>Chess set \u0e3f10,000 1/2 lb.</p> <p>Playing card set \u0e3f5,000 -</p> <p>Poker set \u0e3f50,000 -</p> <p>Herbalism kit \u0e3f10,000 3 lb.</p> <p>Musical instrument</p> <p>Bagpipes \u0e3f300,000 6 lb.</p> <p>Concertina \u0e3f200,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Drum \u0e3f60,000 3 lb.</p> <p>Flute \u0e3f20,000 1 lb.</p> <p>Guitar \u0e3f300,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Lute \u0e3f350,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Lyre \u0e3f300,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Horn \u0e3f30,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Pan flute \u0e3f120,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Piano \u0e3f2,000,000 300 lb.</p> <p>Viol \u0e3f300,000 1 lb.</p> <p>Navigator\u2019s tools  \u0e3f250,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Poisoner\u2019s kit \u0e3f500,000 2 lb.</p> <p>Thieves\u2019 tools \u0e3f250,000 1 lb.</p> <p>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</p> <p>\\page</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Player%20Handbook/#equipment-packs","title":"Equipment Packs","text":"<p>The starting equipment you get from your class includes a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a pack.

Dial effects for both simple and rare dials are listed below.</p> <p>Breath Dial. By storing air, gases, or wind currents, breath dials have the ability to emit anything it absorbs as a gust of energy. Simple breath dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you can absorb up to a 5-foot cube of any gas or wind. By pressing the button on the dial as an action, you can expel up to a 5-foot cube of any stored gas in a space within 5 feet of you. For example, if you absorbed poisonous gas, you may fill up any 5-foot square of space within 5 feet of you with this poisonous gas you as an action. Any creature in the space being filled with gas must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check or be pushed out of the space away from the dial. Objects less than 10 pounds are also pushed out of the space automatically. Simple breath dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of gas, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.</p> <p>Large Breath Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of gas. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead. You can also use a large breath dial to power a standard waver, reducing the cost of building a waver by 80%.</p> <p>Flavor Dial. Similar to breath dials, flavor dials specialize in storing gases and scents. This includes explosive gas or foul odors. However, flavor dials aren't capable of emitting strong gusts that can push things away. Simple flavor dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you can absorb up to a 5-foot cube of any gas or scent. By pressing the button on the dial as an action, you can expel up to a 5-foot cube of any stored gas in a space within 5 feet of you. Simple flavor dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of gas, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.</p> <p>Large Flavor Dials (rare) have 10 charges and can store up to 50 cubic feet of gas. Additionally, they regain 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn instead.</p> <p>Freeze Dial. By absorbing freezing substances or gases, freeze dials can be used to chill and cool off anything by expelling cold elemental energy. Simple freeze dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may sap cold energy from any 5-foot cube of material or gas that is 0\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 F) or less in temperature, such as ice, snow, or frigid air by placing it within 5 feet of the source.

They can be attached to your body or combined with any weapon to amplify its effects. By passively absorbing and storing sharpness from a blade, weight from a blunt weapon, strength from the user's fists and legs, etc. an axe dial will greatly enhance any attack made with a weapon it is attached to. The are three different types of axe dials, each type increasing in both strength and rarity. </p> <p>A +1 axe dial (uncommon) will give any weapon, including your unarmed strikes, a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls when attached.</p> <p>A +2 axe dial (rare) will give any weapon, including your unarmed strikes, a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls when attached.</p> <p>A +3 axe dial (very rare) will give any weapon, including your unarmed strikes, a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls when attached.</p> <p>In order to attach an axe dial to a weapon or body part, the user must spend time during a short or long rest properly fitting and attaching it to the desired weapon. A weapon can only receive the benefits from one dial at a time, and the effects of separate dials on a single weapon do not stack. Furthermore, axe dials do not stack with innate weapon bonus stats, and can only increase a weapon's innate bonuses up to a total +3 for attack or damage rolls. However, axe dial bonuses do stack with bonuses from character feats and abilities. For example, a +3 supreme grade meito would receive no benefits from an axe dial and a +2 great grade meito would only increase to a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the weapon if it had a +3 axe dial attached to it.</p> <p>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</p> <p>\\page</p> <p>Ball Dial (Rare). This dial is almost identical to the large milky dial (use the description from Milky Dial.), except when segments of solid cloud are produced from this dial, they become floating 5-foot diameter balls that can be attached to eachother without breaking. They each have 1 HP and AC 6, and can be pushed up to 30 feet in any direction as a ranged attack, popping on impact with the first thing they touch. Additionally, when a cloud ball is destroyed or popped, it will produce a random effect. Roll a d100 on the wild magic surge table (D&amp;D standard 5th edition rules) to determine the effect, and have the effect target and damage the creature closest to the ball or the ball itself after popping. If the rolled effect grants sorcery points or doesn't have an applicable effect, re-roll on the table instead.</p> <p>Eisen Dial (Rare). The eisen dial is considered one of the strongest types of dials. This dial is almost identical to the simple milky dial (use the description from Milky Dial.), except when segments of solid cloud are produced from this dial, they are as thick and durable as iron. They have 30 HP and AC 20 per 5-foot cube released, and will shatter into metallic dust when destroyed. Additionally, by releasing a 5-foot cube of stored cloud, you may transform it into an iron simple melee weapon of choice that you can use. If you are proficient with rare dials, you are also proficient with the created weapon. This weapon lasts for 1 hour, or until it is dispelled as a bonus action, in which it will crumble into metallic dust afterwards.</p> <p>Flash Dial (Rare). This dial is very similar to a lamp dial, but instead releases stored light in a powerful flash that can blind enemies. Flash dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may absorb up to an hour worth of light or sunlight, for each charge spent, into this dial by holding it or placing it within range of the source without interruption for the desired amount of time. To use this dial, as an action, you can press the button on the dial while holding it to release an hour worth of stored light in a powerful instant flash of blinding light. Each creature aside from the user within 30 feet of the dial has to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn. Flash dials can store up to 5 hours worth of consistent light, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.</p> <p>Flame Dial (Rare). By absorbing flames or burning materials, flame dials can be used to release scorching bursts or beams of fire. Flame dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you may sap fire from any 5-foot cube of fire, magma, or burning material by placing it within 5 feet of the source. To use this dial, as an action, you can release a burst of flames from the dial, one ray for every stored 5-foot cube of fire released, and hurl them at targets within 120 feet. Make a ranged attack for each burst of flame created. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage. Flame dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of fire, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn.</p> <p>Impact Dial (Rare). By absorbing an instance of damage or force from an incoming attack, you can store and later release the force in a devastating burst of concentrated energy. Impact dials have 5 charges. When the user is individually targeted by an attack, spell, or damaging effect, they can use the impact dial to absorb the damage or a portion of it by expending charges as a reaction. Roll a d10 for every charge spent, and reduce the damage of the attack, spell, or effect by the number rolled and store that amount inside of the dial as part of that same reaction. The number stored cannot be more than the total amount of damage rolled by the attack, spell, or effect targeting the user of the dial. Additionally, if the damage rolled by the attack, spell, or effect is reduced to 0, it is nullified and has no effect. </p> <p>To release the stored damage as a concentrated shock wave, the user can spend an action to make a melee attack against a target with the dial, deciding how much stored damage to expend. On a hit, the target takes a number of force damage equal to the expended damage. Whether the attack hits or misses, the user of the dial will be damaged by half of the expended force damage (rounded down) as recoil in force damage as well. Impact dials can store up to 30 force damage at once, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If the stored force damage reaches its cap, any carryover damage that cant be absorbed when attempting to nullify an attack is still dealt to the user and isn't reduced.</p> <p>Jet Dial (Rare). By storing powerful gusts or wind currents, jet dials have the ability to emit anything it absorbs as a gust of energy. Jet dials have 5 charges. By expending a charge from this dial as a bonus action, you can absorb up to a 5-foot cube of any strong wind or gas. By pressing the button on the dial as a bonus action, you can expel at least one 5-foot cube of stored wind to launch you 30 feet x every 5-foot cube of stored wind released in any direction. Jet dials can store up to 25 cubic feet of wind, and regain up to 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn. Additionally, attaching a jet dial to a waver will double its speed.</p> <p>Reject Dial (Rare). Reject dials are one of the strongest and hard to find dials among even the rarest dials. However, reject dials are also incredibly dangerous to use, with the recoil being able to potentially kill anyone who uses them. This dial is almost identical to the impact dial (use the description from Impact Dial.), except it has 10 charges, can store up to 60 force damage, and regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn.</p> <p>Storm Dial (Rare). This dial is almost identical to the simple milky dial (use the description from Milky Dial.), except when segments of solid cloud are produced from this dial, they come in the form of condensed chunks of powerful storm clouds. Every 5-foot cube of storm cloud can be passed through, though it is considered Difficult Terrain. Any creature that ends its turn inside a created storm cloud must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the harsh maelstrom of wind inside the cloud. Additionally, at the start of each round, each 5-foot cube of storm cloud will target the closest creature within 30 feet and deal 1d6 lightning damage to it. Storm clouds only last for 1 minute after being created, in which they return to being an ordinary island or sea cloud after.</p> <p>CHAPTER 5 | EQUIPMENT</p> <p>\\page</p>"},{"location":"English%20docs/Player%20Handbook/#pop-greens","title":"Pop Greens","text":"<p>Pop greens are special seeds that have the power to instantly grow into full plants that produce a desired spell effect.

Additionally, if the spell has a casting time longer than an action, the plant will remain alive and actively cast the spell until it is casted.

Channeling this energy through one's body allows one to achieve a greater tier of power. Haki can exponentially improve a creature's abilities in a variety of ways. It can amplify one's own body, weapons, and ammunition. It can also heighten a creature's senses or even allow for it to develop a \"sixth sense\". Creatures born with \"Qualities of a King\" through sheer luck, however, may instead awaken an incredibly rare form of haki known as \"Haoshoku Haki\" or \"King's Haki\". Though the chances of a creature being born with King's Haki is around one in a million. Each color of haki can be learned and improved through training and combat experience.</p> <p>Each type of Haki is categorized as a separate \"Color\" of Haki. These categories of Haki can be developed instead of Devil Fruit powers through Spirit Surge Events, or might be advanced through other character creation options. There are three known Colors of Haki, as listed below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Color of Armament (or Busoshoku Haki): A creature that develops this type of haki is able to use its spirit as a weapon or suit of armor it can form around its body and weapons. Weapons and attacks coated with this spiritual energy are able affect Devil Fruit users in ways they normally couldn't, such as being able to damage Logia users through their immunity to physical attacks. This normally invisible or transparent energy can also harden on a creature's body or weapons to become a much darker metallic coating which further amplifies its offensive or defensive abilities. Alternatively, it can be channeled through attacks to emit bursts of spiritual energy and destroy objects or creatures from the inside. Creatures that master this haki become nearly unstoppable juggernauts that deal devastating damage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Color of Observation (or Kenbunshoku Haki): A creature that develops this type of haki is able to greatly increase its own senses. Creatures using this haki can detect the auras, presence, strength, and emotions of other creatures around them. When developed over time, creatures can even develop a powerful sixth sense that will allow them to see even when blinded or deafened. Furthermore, at its highest level, this haki allows creatures to see into the future to avoid danger. Creatures that master this form of haki will become nearly impossible to evade or hit with ordinary attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Color of the Supreme King (or Haoshoku Haki): A creature that develops this type of haki is able to use their powerful spirit to force others into submission. Users of this haki are able to easily dominate creatures with weaker willpowers both physically and mentally through unleashing their auras. Creatures dominated by this power may either submit, flee, or become fully incapacitated by it. This haki can also be used like the Color of Armament to imbue attacks with energy, making them far stronger than normal.

La plupart des marins entrent dans cette cat\u00e9gorie.
